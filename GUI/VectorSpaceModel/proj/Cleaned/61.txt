protein conform motion model use sep cma es mass transfer cma es protein conform conform motion problem protein conform motion model an open problem structur comput biolog it difficult solv it use method molecular dynam or quantum physic becaus these method deal with time interv nanosecond or microsecond while conform motion take time millisecond order addit these method not take extern forc into consider cope with these problem numer approxim coars grain method develop which use idea from geometri motion plan present new coars grain method model protein motion between two given conform method base optim cost function similar one mong kantorovich mass transfer problem optim perform use sep cma es which make run time an iter linear number amino acid protein propos method compar with some exist method sever molecul it shown that result propos method more accur than other method
