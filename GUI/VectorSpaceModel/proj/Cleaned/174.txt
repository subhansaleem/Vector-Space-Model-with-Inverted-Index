recogn human activ from raw acceleromet data use deep neural network activ recognit deep neural network featur learn acceleromet data activ recognit from wearabl sensor data been research mani year previou work usual extract featur manual which were hand design by research then were fed into classifi input due blind manual extract featur it wa hard choos suitabl featur specif classif task besid thi heurist method featur extract could not gener across differ applic domain becaus differ applic domain need extract differ featur classif there wa also work that use auto encod learn featur automat then fed featur into k nearest neighbor classifi howev these featur were learn an unsupervis manner without use inform label thu might not relat specif classif task thi paper recommend deep neural network dnn activ recognit which automat learn suitabl featur dnn overcom blind hand design featur make use preciou label inform improv activ recognit perform did experi three publicli avail dataset activ recognit compar deep neural network with tradit method includ those that extract featur manual auto encod follow by k nearest neighbor classifi result show that deep neural network could gener across differ applic domain got higher accuraci than tradit method
