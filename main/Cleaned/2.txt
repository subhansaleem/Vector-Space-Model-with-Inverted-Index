improving spectral learning by using multiple representation representation spectral learning discrete fourier basis selection ensemble spectral learning algorithm learn an unknown function by learning spectral e g fourier representation function however there many possible spectral representation none which will best situation consequently it seems natural consider how spectral learner could make use multiple representation when learning this paper proposes compare three approach learning from multiple spectral representation empirical result suggest that an ensemble approach multi spectrum learning which spectral model learned independently each set candidate representation then combined majority vote ensemble work best practice
