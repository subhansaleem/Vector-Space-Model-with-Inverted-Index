prediction continuous phenotype mouse fly rice genome wide association study with support vector regression snp ridge regression classifier phenotype prediction snp selection support vector regression genome wide association study ridge regression ranking snp prediction phenotype continuous genome wide association study subject increasing interest with application personalized medicine animal plant breeding ranking snp case control discrete label genome wide association study been examined several previous study with machine learning technique but this poorly explored study with quantitative label here study ranking snp mouse fly rice continuous genome wide association study given by popular univariate pearson correlation coefficient multivariate support vector regression ridge regression perform cross validation with support vector regression ridge regression model top ranked snp compute correlation coefficient between true predicted phenotype our result show that ridge regression prediction with top ranked support vector regression snp give highest accuracy datasets achieve accuracy comparable previously published value but with fewer snp our work show learn parsimonious snp model predicting continuous label genome wide study
