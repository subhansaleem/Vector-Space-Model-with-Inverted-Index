performance analysis majority vote combiner multiple classifier system multiple classifier system majority vote rule probability classification error combining rule multiple classifier system mc play central role shaping their performance classification error probability many theoretical work developed predict performance using different combining rule some developed work assumed that classifier output independent however practice an ensemble classifier show dependent behavior between each other this work theoretical model derived estimating misclassification error probability mc based majority vote combiner derivation assumed that each classifier produce it output an estimation posterior class probability that gaussian distribution addition assumed that each classifier two class output classifier dependent identically distributed validated our model using computer simulation result show that ensemble performance highly sensitive class variance while exhibit smoother behavior against class mean also result show that correlation among classifier output increase probability classification error degrades exponentially trend continues until performance reach behavior single classifier regardless number base classifier used ensemble proposed model provides better understanding behavior majority vote combiner mc
