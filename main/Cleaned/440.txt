bayesian network inverse inference manufacturing bayesian network inverse inference manufacturing bayesian network physic based simulation manufacturing process used prediction material property defect number industrial application however practising engineer often requires solution an inverse problem prediction input desired outcome inverse problem usually solved by constrained optimisation extensive simulation during optimisation avoided through response surface constructed from simulation but design space often so large that even with response surface optimisation might not possible moreover these problem typically ill posed so discriminative model such artificial neural network not work well this paper investigate application conditional linear gaussian bayesian network address inverse problem with multi pas wire drawing process case study propose an approach systematically find solution rank them according their likelihood
