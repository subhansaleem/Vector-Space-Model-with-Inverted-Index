oups combined approach using smote propensity score matchingtching accuracy sensitivity data model machine learning algorithm training equation building accurate classifier difficult when using data that skewed or imbalanced which typical real world data set two popular approach that been applied improving classification accuracy statistical comparison imbalanced data set synthetic minority over sampling technique smote propensity score matching psm novel sampling approach introduced referred over sampling using propensity score oups that blend two simple easy perform resulting improvement accuracy sensitivity over both smote psm performance our proposed approach assessed using simulation experiment several performance metric shown where this approach fare fall comparison others
