speaker adaptation using speaker similarity score dnn feature deep neural network k nearest neighbor phoneme classification feature learning speaker adaptation this paper proposes novel speaker adaptation algorithm classifying speech based deep neural network dnns adaptation algorithm consists two step first step deep neural network trained using raw mel frequency cepstral coefficient mfcc feature discover hidden structure data employing activation last hidden layer dnn acoustic feature second step using nearest neighbor an adaptation algorithm learns speaker similarity score based small amount adaptation data from each target speaker using dnn based acoustic feature based speaker similarity score classification done using k nearest neighbor k nn classifier novelty this work that instead modifying re training dnn speaker adaptation which comprises large number parameter computationally expensive activation learned dnn used project feature from mfcc sparse dnn space then speaker adaptation performed based similarity i e nearest neighbor using k nn algorithm with only small amount adaptation data it reduces number phoneme classification error timit dataset by 23 this work also analyzes impact deep neural network architecture speaker adaptation performance
