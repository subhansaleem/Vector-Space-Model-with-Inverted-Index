conformalized kernel ridge regression kernel ridge regression gaussian process regression conformal prediction confidence region general predictive model not provide measure confidence prediction without bayesian assumption way circumvent potential restriction use conformal method constructing non parametric confidence region that offer guarantee regarding validity this paper provide detailed description computationally efficient conformal procedure kernel ridge regression krr conduct comparative numerical study see how well conformal region perform against bayesian confidence set result suggest that conformalized krr yield predictive confidence region with specified coverage rate which essential constructing anomaly detection system based predictive model
