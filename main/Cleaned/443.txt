learning effective query management strategy from big data query relaxation functional dependency web based information source availability big data collection together with powerful hardware software mechanism process them give nowadays possibility learn useful insight from data which exploited multiple purpose including marketing fault prevention so forth however it also possible learn important metadata that suggest how data should manipulated several advanced operation this paper show potentiality learning from data by focusing problem relaxing result database query that trying return some approximated answer query when result it unavailable database system will return an empty answer set or even worse erroneous mismatch result particular introduce novel approach rewrite query that disjunctive normal form contain mixture discrete continuous attribute approach preprocesses data collection discover implicit relationship that exist among various domain attribute then us this knowledge rewrite constraint from failing query first step approach try learn set functional dependency from data which ranked according special mechanism that will successively allow predict order which extracted dependency used properly rewrite failing query an experimental evaluation approach three real data set show it effectiveness term robustness coverage
