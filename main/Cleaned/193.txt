investigating new bootstrapping approach bagging classifier account class imbalance bioinformatics datasets class imbalance bagging bootstrap approach bioinformatics one major challenge posed by bioinformatics datasets class imbalance which occurs when one class many more instance than other class e it undesirable effect classification performance compounded with fact that general class with fewer instance class interest bagging been utilized by practitioner field overcome challenge class imbalance improve classification performance our motivation this study investigate whether change bootstrapping step bagging classifier further improve their performance specifically these modification bootstrapping process take into account membership class performed an extensive empirical study utilizing four bootstrap approach within bagging framework using three feature ranker along with four feature subset size two base classifier across 15 imbalanced bioinformatics datasets three these bootstrap approach were proposed implemented by our research team this study our result show that new approach improve performance over classic bootstrap approach with balanced bagging having highest performance however observed increase performance not statistically significant recommend balanced bootstrap approach because it show most improvement term frequency having highest performance it generates fully balanced bootstrap datasets that account class imbalance problem uniqueness this paper proposing implementing three innovative bootstrapping approach examine effect these bootstrapping process against classic one performance bagging classifier domain bioinformatics
