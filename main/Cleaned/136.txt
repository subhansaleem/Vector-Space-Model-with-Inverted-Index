predictable feature analysis data analysis dimensionality reduction feature extraction model building predictability self organization signal analysis unsupervised learning every organism an environment whether biological robotic or virtual must able predict certain aspect it environment order survive or perform whatever task intended it need model that capable estimating consequence possible action so that planning control decision making become feasible scientific purpose such model usually created problem specific manner using differential equation other technique from control system theory contrast that aim an unsupervised approach that build desired model self organized fashion inspired by slow feature analysis sfa our approach extract subsignals from input that behave predictable possible these predictable feature highly relevant modeling because predictability desired property needed consequence estimating model by definition our approach measure predictability with respect certain prediction model focus here solution arising optimization problem present tractable algorithm based algebraic method which call predictable feature analysis pfa prove that algorithm find globally optimal signal if this signal predicted with low error deal with case where optimal signal significant prediction error provide robust heuristically motivated variant algorithm verify it empirically additionally give formal criterion prediction model must meet suitable measuring predictability pfa setting also provide suitable default model along with formal proof that it meet these criterion
