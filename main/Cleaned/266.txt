multifaceted approach bitcoin fraud detection global local outlier kd tree anomaly outlier data mining random forest regression bitcoin network lack class label tend cause obscurity anomalous financial behaviour interpretation understand fraud latest development financial sector multifaceted approach proposed this paper bitcoin fraud described from both global local perspective using trimmed k mean kd tree two sphere investigated further through random forest maximum likelihood based boosted binary regression model although both angle show good performance global outlier perspective outperforms local viewpoint with exception random forest that exhibit nearby perfect result from both dimension this signifies that feature extracted this study describe network fairly
