speaker identification medical simulation data using fisher vector representation speaker identification gaussian mixture model gmm fisher vector fv feature representation k nearest neighbor classifier knn support vector machine svm present robust speaker identification algorithm that us effective feature based fisher vector fv representation first low level spectral feature extracted from training data next model data spectral feature space by mixture gaussian component then construct fv descriptor based deviation feature from gaussian component analyze fv feature representation speech data with two common classifier k nearest neighbor classifier knn support vector machine svm proposed approach evaluated using audio data set recorded simulate medical crisis show that proposed fv feature representation approach achieves significant improvement when compared state art method
