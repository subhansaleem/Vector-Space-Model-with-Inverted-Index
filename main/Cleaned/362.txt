automatic generation recommendation api mashups ap imashups nlp machine learning deep learning until today finding most suitable apis use an application wa burdensome requiring manual time consuming search across diverse set website particular regarding how multiple apis could combined worked together i e api mashups this paper propose new method automatically generate api mashups through real world data collection text mining natural language processing nlp technique generated api mashups further ranked recommended developer based quantitative indicator whether given api mashup plausible evaluate overall accuracy proposed method use generated api mashups train several machine learning deep learning model then use an independent mashup dataset collected from github project testing experimental result show that our proposed method feasible accurate automatic api mashup generation recommendation
