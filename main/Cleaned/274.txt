consensus clustering resampling based method building radiation hybrid map radiation hybrid mapping clustering resampling building radiation hybrid rh map challenging process traditional rh mapping technique very time consuming not work well noisy datasets this presented research propose new approach that us resampling technique with consensus clustering technique filter out unreliable marker build robust rh map short time main aim using proposed approach first reduce mapping computational complexity thus speeding mapping process second filter out unreliable marker map remaining reliable marker build robust map proposed approach map rh datasets four step follows 1 us jackknife resampling technique resample rh dataset group resampled datasets into cluster 2 build consensus cluster filter out unreliable marker 3 map consensus cluster 4 connects consensus cluster map form final map demonstrate performance our proposed approach compare accuracy constructed map with corresponding physical map also compare running time our constructed map with carthagene tool map running time result show that proposed approach construct robust map comparatively very short time
