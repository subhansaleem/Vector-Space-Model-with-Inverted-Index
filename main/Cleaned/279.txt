identifying nontechnical power loss via spatial temporal deep learning autoencoder deep learning long short term memory nontechnical loss unsupervised learning transfer learning fraud detection electricity consumption major challenge power distribution company while many pattern recognition technique been applied identify electricity theft they often require extensive handcrafted feature engineering instead through deep layer transformation nonlinearity abstraction deep learning dl automatically extract key feature from data this paper design spatial temporal deep learning solution identify nontechnical power loss ntl including convolutional neural network cnn long short term memory lstm stacked autoencoder these model evaluated modified ieee 123 bus test feeder same test also conduct comparison experiment using three conventional machine learning approach random forest decision tree shallow neural network experimental result demonstrate that spatiotemporal deep learning approach outperform conventional machine learning approach
