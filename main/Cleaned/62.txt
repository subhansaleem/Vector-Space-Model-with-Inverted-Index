budgeted learning developing personalized treatment reinforcement learning budgeted learning bayesian active learning personalized treatment there increased interest using patient specific information personalize treatment personalized treatment decision rule learned using data from standard clinical trial but such trial very costly run this paper explores use budgeted learning technique design more efficient clinical trial by effectively determining which type patient recruit each time throughout duration trial propose bayesian bandit model discus computational challenge issue pertaining this approach compare our budgeted learning algorithm which approximately minimizes bayes risk using both simulated data data modeled after clinical trial treating depressed individual with other plausible algorithm show that our budgeted learning algorithm demonstrated excellent performance across wide variety situation
