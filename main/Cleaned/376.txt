lecture vdeo indexing using boosted margin maximizing neural network video indexing image matching convolutional neural network boosting this paper present novel approach lecture video indexing using boosted deep convolutional neural network system indexing performed by matching high quality slide image which text either known or extracted lower resolution video frame with possible noise perspective distortion occlusion propose deep neural network integrated with boosting framework composed two sub network targeting feature extraction similarity determination perform matching trained network given input pair slide image candidate video frame image produce similarity between them boosting framework integrated into our proposed network during training process experimental result show that proposed approach much more capable handling occlusion spatial transformation other type noise when compared with known approach
