time warping symbolic aggregation approximation with bag pattern representation time series classification time series analysis correlation standard error analysis vector electrocardiography training standard symbolic aggregation approximation sax core many effective time series data mining algorithm it combination with bag pattern become standard approach with bleeding edge performance standard datasets however standard sax with bop representation might neglect internal temporal correlation embedded data this paper proposed time warping sax which extends standard sax method with time delay embedding vector approach by considering temporal correlation test time warping sax with bop representation 12 benchmark dataset from ucr time series classification clustering page 9 them time warping sax overtakes state th eart performance standard sax validate our method real world application new dataset vital sign collected from patient who may require blood transfusion prbc next 6 hour tested result demonstrate that by considering temporal internal correlation our time warping sax with bop representation could significantly enhance representation power
