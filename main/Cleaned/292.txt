system level test case prioritization using machine learning system level testing black box testing test case prioritization supervised machine learning regression testing common task retesting software that been changed or extended e g by new feature during software evolution retesting whole program not feasible with reasonable time cost usually only subset test case executed regression testing e g by executing test case according test case prioritization although vast amount method test case prioritization exist they mostly require access source code i e white box however industrial practice system level testing an important task that usually grant access source code i e black box hence an effective regression testing process other information employed this paper introduce novel technique test case prioritization manual system level regression testing based supervised machine learning our approach considers black box meta data such test case history well natural language test case description prioritization use machine learning algorithm svm rank evaluate our approach by mean two subject system measure prioritization quality our result imply that our technique improves failure detection rate significantly compared random order addition able outperform test case order given by test expert moreover using natural language description improves failure finding rate
