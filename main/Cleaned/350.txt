clustering distributed short time series with dense pattern time series clustering short time series distributed data clustering clustering gene with similar temporal profile an important task gene expression data analysis current approach clustering sparse gene expression data with temporal information suffer from their least quadratic complexity number cluster number gene or both not distributed this paper present first distributed density based approach short time series clustering called dtscluster which suitable gene expression data dtscluster identifies dense pattern distributed datasets us them generate time series cluster comparative experimental result revealed that dtscluster scalable dataset size with linear complexity time space outperforms other representative approach term cluster validation with silhouette index well distributed scenario also open opportunity collaborative data mining between different gene expression data holder
