adaptive thresholding reweighting improve domain transfer learning unbalanced data with application eeg imbalance transfer learning imbalance adaptive threshold domain adaptation method highly sensitive class balance particularly usually unknown balance unlabeled test set this work analyze effect imbalance well known algorithm artl adaptation regularization transfer learning propose four approach mitigating adverse effect imbalance these include 1 balancing training set pseudo label calculation 2 applying adaptive thresholding pseudo label calculation 3 using class reweighting optimization objective 4 applying adaptive thresholding output objective tested these method with uci newsgroup dataset three type imbalanced eeg electroencephalogram classification problem observed significant improvement particularly case extreme imbalance which not well addressed by standard classification technique
