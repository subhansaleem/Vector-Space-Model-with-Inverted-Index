realistic traffic generation web robot web robot generative model web caching critical evaluating capacity scalability availability web system realistic web traffic generator web traffic generation classic research problem generator account characteristic web robot or crawler that now dominant source traffic web server administrator thus unable test stress evaluate how their system perform face ever increasing level web robot traffic resolve this problem this paper introduces novel approach generate synthetic web robot traffic with high fidelity it generates traffic that account both temporal behavioral quality robot traffic by statistical bayesian model that fitted property robot traffic seen web log from north america europe evaluate our traffic generator by comparing characteristic generated traffic those original data look session arrival rate inter arrival time session length comparing contrasting them between generated real traffic finally show that our generated traffic affect cache performance similarly actual traffic using common lru lfu eviction policy
