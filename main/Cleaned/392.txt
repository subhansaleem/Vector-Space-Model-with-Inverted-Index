effect communication noncooperative multiplayer multi armed bandit problem multi armed bandit online learning game theory reinforcement learning consider decentralized stochastic multi armed bandit problem with multiple player case different communication probability between player each player make decision pulling an arm without cooperation while aiming maximize or reward but informs or neighbor end every turn about arm he or she pulled reward he or she got neighbor player determined according an erdos rényi graph with connectivity which reproduced beginning every turn consider i i d reward generated by bernoulli distribution assume that player unaware about arm probability distribution their mean value case collision assume that only one player who randomly chosen get reward where others get zero reward study effect degree communication between player cumulative regret using well known algorithm ucb1 greedy thompson sampling
