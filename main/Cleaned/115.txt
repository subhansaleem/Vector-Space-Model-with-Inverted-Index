statistical fault localization based importance sampling fault localization importance sampling this paper present novel probabilistic approach fault localization challenge based importance sampling iterative approach utilizes test result execution profile estimate likelihood suspiciousness program statement over few iteration probability update sampling procedure directs it attention towards those statement that more likely faulty proposed approach designed more sensitive failing test case comparison passing test case effectiveness proposed stochastic approach evaluated through two case study result compared against other popular fault localization method
