advanced echmm based machine learning tool complex big data application workload characterization hmm cepstral coefficient present novel approach accurate characterization workload which relevant context complex big data application workload generally described with statistical model based analysis resource request measurement running program this paper propose consider sequence virtual memory reference generated from program during it execution temporal series use spectral analysis principle process sequence however sequence time varying so employed processing approach based ergodic continuous hidden markov model echmms which extend conventional stationary spectral analysis approach analysis time varying sequence this work describe two application proposed approach line classification running process generation synthetic trace given workload first step wa show that echmms accurately describe virtual memory sequence this goal different echmm wa trained each sequence related run time average process classification accuracy evaluated using trace driven simulation over wide range trace spec2000 wa about 82 then single echmm wa trained using sequence obtained from given running application again classification accuracy been evaluated using same trace it resulted about 76 regard synthetic trace generation single echmm characterizing given application been used stochastic generator produce benchmark spanning large application space
