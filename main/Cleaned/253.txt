cross document knowledge discovery using semantic concept topic model knowledge discovery topic model latent dirichlet allocation hierarchical dirichlet process bag concept topic model employ bag word bow representation which break term into constituent word treat word surface string without assuming predefined knowledge about word meaning this paper propose semantic concept latent dirichlet allocation sclda semantic concept hierarchical dirichlet process schdp based approach by representing text meaningful concept rather than word using new model known bag concept boc propose new algorithm applying sclda schdp into concept chain query ccq problem algorithm focused discovering new semantic relationship between two concept across document where relationship found reveal semantic path linking two concept across multiple text unit experiment demonstrate search quality been greatly improved compared with using other lda or hdp based approach
