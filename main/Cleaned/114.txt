influence sample reconstruction stock trend prediction via narx neural network trend prediction stock trading point narx sample reconstruction artificial neural network our study through established narx neural network model sample data stock aapl nasdaq from 2006 01 01 2015 01 01 utilized training result show that under same sampling frequency with increase ma period trend volatility becomes lower with obvious longer time delay which will help predict trend movement addition through use reconstructed data containing trend information training sample it significantly reduced prediction error which 16 29 lower than using daily training sample 16 90 lower than using weekly training sample output directly reflect probability trend movement every time point stock price it also improves generalization ability narx model so predict stock trend change certain time it successfully estimated possibility buying selling point which provides necessary theoretical basis how determine stock trading point
