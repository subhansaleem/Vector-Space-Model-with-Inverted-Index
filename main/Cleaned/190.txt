learning convex piecewise linear machine data driven optimal control learning convex function data driven optimal control piecewise linear data driven optimal control op scheme one or more involved component such objective function system dynamic or operation constraint described with statistical model learned from data this work focus machine learning operation constraint which rarely addressed previous research although rich collection supervised learning method exist literature most them not suitable modeling operation constraint because their decision rule usually induce undesirable non linear coupling system variable order surpass simple linear model while same time maintaining compatibility with downstream control application propose describe system operation requirement by convex piecewise linear machine cplm which doe not incur any difficulty optimization directly pluggable generalization performance proposed classifier analyzed through bounding it vc dimension large margin cost sensitive learning objective formulated with bayes consistent hinge loss solve training problem by online stochastic gradient descent propose mixed integer based initialization method case study heating ventilation air conditioning hvac system control with comfort requirement conducted result show that cplm not only promising candidate cost sensitive learning general but also enables much better description exploitation system operation region optimal control purpose
