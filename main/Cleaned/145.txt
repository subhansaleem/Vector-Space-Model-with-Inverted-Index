highly distributable computational framework fast cloud data retrieval distributed computing parallel processing associative memory cloud computing neural network hierachical graph neuron unlike existing relational hierarchical object oriented scheme associative model analyze data similar way which our brain link information such interaction when implemented voluminous data cloud assist searching overarching relation complex highly distributed data set with speed accuracy this paper different perspective data recognition will considered rather than looking conventional approach such statistical computation deterministic learning scheme this paper will focusing distributed processing approach scalable data recognition processing through applying an access scheme that will enable fast data retrieval across multiple record data segment associatively utilizing parallel approach doing so will yield new form databaselike functionality that scale or down over available infrastructure without interruption or degradation dynamically automatically our proposed model data record treated pattern result data storage retrieval performed using distributed pattern recognition approach that implemented through integration loosely coupled computational network followed by divide distribute approach that facilitates distribution these network within cloud dynamically
