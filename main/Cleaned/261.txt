machine learning plant disease incidence severity measurement from leaf image machine learning computer vision image based diagnosis feature selection many field superior gain been obtained by leveraging computational power machine learning technique solve expert task this paper present an application machine learning agriculture solving particular problem diagnosis crop disease based plant image taken with smartphone two piece information important here disease incidence disease severity present classification system that train 5 class classification system determine state disease plant 5 class represent health class 4 disease class further extend classification system classify different severity level any 4 disease severity level assigned class 1 5 1 being healthy plant 5 being severely diseased plant present way extracting different feature from leaf image show how different extraction method result different performance classifier finally present smartphone based system that us classification model learnt real time prediction state health farmer garden this work by farmer uploading an image plant garden obtaining disease score from remote server
