noise prediction time domain subtraction approach deep neural network based speech enhancement speech enhancement deep neural network noise estimation speech quality speech intelligibility deep neural network dnns recently been successfully applied speech enhancement task however low signal noise ratio snr performance dnn based speech enhancement system remains le than desirable this paper study an approach dnn based speech enhancement based noise prediction three speech enhancement model based noise prediction proposed their performance compared that conventional spectral mapping model seen unseen noise test objective test result show that proposed noise prediction model perform well enhancing speech quality seen noise condition enhancing high snr speech signal they also perform well enhancing speech intelligibility both seen unseen noise condition but not outperform conventional model quality metric unseen noise condition further analysis enhanced speech signal undertaken explain observed result
