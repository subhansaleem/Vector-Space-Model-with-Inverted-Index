learning coordinate with deep reinforcement learning double pong game artificial intelligence deep reinforcement learning multi agent system cooperative system this paper discus emergence cooperative coordinated behavior between joint concurrent learning agent using deep q learning multi agent system ma arise variety domain collective effort one main building block many fundamental system that exist world thus sequential decision making under uncertainty collaborative work one important challenging issue intelligent cooperative multiple agent however decision cooperation highly sophisticated complicated because agent may certain shared goal or individual goal achieve their behavior inevitably influenced by each other therefore attempt explore whether agent using deep q network dqn learn cooperative behavior use double pong game an example investigate how they learn divide their work through iterated game execution our approach agent jointly learn divide their area responsibility each agent us it own dqn modify it behavior also investigate how learned behavior change according environmental characteristic including reward scheme learning technique our experiment indicate that effective cooperative behavior with balanced division workload emerge these result help u better understand how agent behave interact with each other complex environment how they coherently choose their individual action such that resulting joint action optimal
