ensemble statistical heuristic model unsupervised word alignment statistical word alignment ensemble learning heuristic word alignment statistical word alignment model need large amount training data while they weak small size corpus this paper proposes new approach unsupervised hybrid word alignment technique using ensemble learning method this algorithm us three base alignment model several round generate alignment ensemble algorithm us weighed scheme resampling training data voting score consider aggregated alignment underlying alignment algorithm used this study include ibm model 1 2 heuristic method based dice measurement our experimental result show that by this approach alignment error rate could improved by least 15 base alignment model
