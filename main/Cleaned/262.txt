exposing inpainting forgery jpeg image under recompression attack inpainting combination forgery jpeg recompression image forgery detection inpainting originally designed computer vision reconstruct lost or deteriorated part image video been used image tampering including region filling object removal alter truth while several type tampering including copy move seam carving forgery now successfully exposed image forensics there been very little study tackle inpainting forgery jpeg image detection which extremely challenging due post recompression attack performed cover or compromise original inpainting trace date there effective way detect inpainting image forgery under combined recompression attack fill such gap image forensics reveal inpainting forgery from post recompression attack jpeg image propose this paper an approach that begin with large feature mining discrete transform domain ensemble learning then applied deal with high feature dimensionality prevent overfitting that generally happens some regular classifier under high feature dimension our study show proposed approach effectively expose inpainting forgery under post recompression attack especially it noticeably improves detection accuracy while recompression quality lower than original jpeg image quality thus bridge gap image forgery detection
