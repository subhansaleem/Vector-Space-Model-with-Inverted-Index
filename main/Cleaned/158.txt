prediction sunspot number using minimum error entropy cost based kernel adaptive filter kernel method error entropy information theoretic learning several algorithm adaptive filtering based minimization mean squared error mse cost function however mse just second order statistic hence doe not capture entire information about probability distribution error system an information theoretic alternative using minimum error entropy mee cost function adaptive algorithm based this criterion been developed shown superior compared mse counterpart this work kernel version some these method designed tested predicting annual sunspot number sunspot number number visibly darker region solar surface been shown instrumental modeling space weather state ionosphere climatic anomaly even global warming comparative performance study various linear kernel algorithm trained with both mee mse criterion predicting such chaotic non linear time series presented this paper experimental result clearly show advantage mee based kernel design which per expectation given that it advantage being non linear along with being able derive maximum information from error distribution
