source aware partitioning robust cross validation machine learning cross validation source aware robust learning one most critical component engineering machine learning algorithm live application robust performance assessment prior it implementation cross validation used forecast specific algorithm s classification or prediction accuracy new input data given finite dataset training testing algorithm two most well known cross validation technique random subsampling r k fold used generalize assessment result machine learning algorithm non exhaustive random manner this work first show that an inertia based activity recognition problem where data collected from different user wrist worn wireless accelerometer random partitioning data regardless cross validation technique result statistically similar average accuracy standard feed forward neural network classifier propose novel source aware partitioning technique where sample from specific user completely left out training validation set rotation average error proposed cross validation method significantly higher with lower standard variation which major indicator cross validation robustness approximately 30 increase average error rate implies that source aware cross validation could better indication live algorithm performance where test data statistic would significantly different than training data due source or user sensitive nature process data
