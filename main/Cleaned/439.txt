predictive model hard drive failure based operational data predictive model hidden markov model support vector machine drive feature extraction training hard drive an essential component modern data storage order reduce risk data loss hard drive failure prediction method using self monitoring analysis reporting technology attribute been proposed however these method were developed from datasets not necessarily representative operational system this paper consider backblaze public dataset recent operational dataset from over 47 000 drive exhibiting hard drive heterogeneity with 81 model from 5 manufacturer an extremely unbalanced ratio 5000 1 between healthy failure sample realworld loosely controlled environment observe that existing predictive model longer perform sufficiently well this dataset therefore selected machine learning classification method able deal with very unbalanced training set namely svm rf gbt adapted them specific constraint hard drive failure prediction our result reach over 95 precision 67 recall one year real world public dataset over 12 million record with only 2586 failure
