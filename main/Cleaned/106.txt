feature selection using gustafson kessel fuzzy algorithm high dimension data clustering feature selection informative weight fuzzy clustering cluster validation performance objective function based fuzzy clustering algorithm depends shape volume cluster initialization clustering algorithm distribution data object number cluster data feature selection also one most important issue high dimension data clustering specifically bioinformatics data mining signal processing etc where feature space dimension tends very large making both clustering classification task very difficult it evident that feature subset needed successfully perform given clustering recognition task depends discriminatory quality chosen feature propose new hybrid approach addressing feature selection based informative weight which take into account membership degree feature performed by gustafson kessel fuzzy algorithm purpose efficiently achieve high degree dimensionality reduction enhance or maintain predictive accuracy with selected feature candidate feature subset generated by using iterative feature elimination procedure which result estimation feature informative weight use both supervised unsupervised method order evaluate clustering ability feature subset
