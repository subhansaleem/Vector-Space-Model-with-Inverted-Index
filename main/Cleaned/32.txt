learning rank with only positive example information need modeling positive unlabeled learning transductive learning search by multiple example key successfully retrieve relevant document lie how user express their information need using keywords query however many user it difficult them use keywords express their information need search by multiple example sbme promising method overcoming this problem allows user specify their information need set relevant document rather than set keywords this study propose transductive positive unlabeled learning tpu learning based framework document ranking framework consists two step 1 identifying potential relevant document reduce searching space from entire data collection smaller dataset 2 adopting tpu learning method re rank searching space by treating relevant document from user positive example p document searching space unlabeled data u using map p k evaluate two state art pu learning algorithm rocchio classifier rc document ranking proposed framework with different size p simulate user online search behavior then adopt idea ensemble learning combine rc with two state art pu learning algorithm respectively experiment conducted two real datasets show that ensemble learning based method lead significant improvement performance
