multilabel classification with weighted label using learning classifier system learning classifier system multi label classification uncertain label evolutionary based learning this work michigan style strength based learning classifier system which rule based supervised learning algorithm extended handle multi label classification task moreover it assumed that class membership training data partially known uncertainty represented by confidence value that reflects probability each label being true necessary parameter introduced learning classifier modified learn simultaneously confidence level multi label training data additionally quantify classifier performance novel loss measure introduced that generalizes well known hamming loss criterion take into account classification error confidence estimation error simultaneously algorithm tested one real world data two synthetic data set result show ability model learning multi class multi label data with low confidence estimation error
