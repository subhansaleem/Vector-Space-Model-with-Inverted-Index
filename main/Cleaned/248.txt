correlating filter diversity with convolutional neural network accuracy convolutional neural network regularization normalization preprocessing this paper describes three metric used ass filter diversity learned by convolutional neural network during supervised classification our testbed use four different data set including two subset imagenet two planktonic data set collected by scientific instrument investigate correlation between our devised metric accuracy using normalization regularization alter filter diversity propose that these metric could used improve training cnns three potential application determining best preprocessing method non standard data set diagnosing training efficacy predicting performance case where validation data expensive or impossible collect
