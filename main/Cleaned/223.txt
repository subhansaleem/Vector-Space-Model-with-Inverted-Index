neural network based kidney segmentation from mr image preliminary result kidney segmentation neural network mr image automated robust kidney segmentation from medical image sequence very difficult task particularly because gray level similarity adjacent organ partial volume effect injection contrast medium addition these difficulty variation kidney shape position gray level make automated identification segmentation kidney harder also different image characteristic with different scanner much more increase difficulty segmentation task therefore this paper present an automated kidney segmentation method by using multi layer perceptron based approach that adapts parameter according image handle these challenging problem efficiency term segmentation performance achieved by using information from previously segmented kidney image proposed approach also efficient term required processing time since it doe not include pre processing training stage which very time consuming moreover unsupervised segmentation approach eliminates common problem most neural network based approach that dependency result chosen data training stage
