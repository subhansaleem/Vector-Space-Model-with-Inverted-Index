tool machine with brain touchless wheel alignment with neural network training with noisy data wheel alignment 2 dim distance measure neural network kohonen self organizing network association map this document describes proof concept new approach next generation wheel alignment system propose measure relevant angel with kohonen self organizing network from an image heavy precision camera instead projecting system clamped wheel this clear advantage that not need attach specially designed clamp which hold wheel with mirror scale or led that target system will shot photo from each wheel from well determined position calculate relevant angel from it with kohonen self organizing neural network compare utility several distance measure retrieve best association map which determines necessary coordinate system designed learning system that need certain amount training training designed that it surely converges after well determined number run further optimize training using noisy data system designed car manufacturer that need measure many similar car daily basis
