dynamic factor mixture expert functional time series modeling functional time series dynamic factor analysis mixture expert visualization state space model variational em new approach introduced this paper dynamic modeling dimensionality reduction from time series curve this purpose dynamic mixture expert model whose regression coefficient evolve from curve curve according gaussian random walk over low dimensional factor proposed resulting model neither else than particular state space model involving discrete continuous latent variable whose parameter learned across sequence curve through dedicated variational expectation maximization algorithm experimental study conducted simulated sequence curve shown strong potential proposed approach
