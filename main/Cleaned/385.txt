integrated framework improving large scale hierarchical classification hierarchical classification inconsistency logistic regression scalability orphan node prediction hierarchical classification hc approach leverage hierarchical structure during training testing model which help improvement classification performance prediction efficiency however their performance improvement comparison flat approach may poor if hierarchy used training contains i inconsistent hierarchical relationship such parent child or sibling ii le cohesive or overlapping class moreover dynamic change data characteristic over time requires new class orphan node identified improve generalization performance learned model addition also need deal with imbalance data large scale problem where large number class few example training posing statistical challenge this paper propose an integrated framework address aforementioned issue improving large scale hc our experimental evaluation various image text datasets show improved performance with our proposed framework
