towards sleep apnea screening with an under mattress ir uwb radar using machine learning obstructive apnea hypopnea ultra wide band radar this work apply machine learning investigate effectiveness an impulse radio ultra wide band ir uwb radar panel an under mattress configuration detecting apnea event subject known obstructive sleep apnea osa consider collection feature some novel some inspired by feature that worked well sleep apnea detection using other type sensor i e not ir uwb extract feature collected total 25 hour data from four subject they slept through night data included digitized sample ir uwb radar return signal scored polysomnograph psg which gold standard measure large number physiological parameter well equipped sleep laboratory normal apnea epoch were extracted from ir uwb data corresponding normal apnea epoch psg data statistical feature were derived from these extracted epoch linear discriminant classifier wa trained using cross validation found that classifier an accuracy around 70 detection apnea normal epoch novel aspect this project involves processing investigation different method feature extraction data obtained from real apnea subject suggests that radar when paired with other under mattress sensor might provide an effective screening device convenient form factor
