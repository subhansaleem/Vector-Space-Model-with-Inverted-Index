machine learning optimum ct prediction qpcr machine learning qpcr ct prediction algorithm sigmoid introduction fluorescence based real time pcr rt pcr increasingly used detect multiple pathogen simultaneously rapidly by gene expression analysis pcr amplification data pcr data analyzed often by setting an arbitrary threshold that intersect signal curve it exponential phase if it exists point which curve cross threshold called threshold cycle ct positive sample other when such cross threshold doe not occur sample identified negative this simple arbitrary however not an elagant definition ct value sometimes lead conclusion that either false positive or negative therefore purpose this paper present stable consistent alternative approach that based machine learning definition determination ct value
