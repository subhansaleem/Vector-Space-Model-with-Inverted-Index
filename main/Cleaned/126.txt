medical image classification via svm using lbp feature from saliency based folded data image classification saliency folding local binary pattern support vector machine good result image classification retrieval using support vector machine svm with local binary pattern lbps feature been extensively reported literature where an entire image retrieved or classified contrast medical imaging not part image may equally significant or relevant image retrieval application hand instance lung x ray image lung region may contain tumour hence being highly significant whereas surrounding area doe not contain significant information from medical diagnosis perspective this paper propose detect salient region image during training fold data reduce effect irrelevant region result smaller image area will used lbp feature calculation consequently classification by svm use irma 2009 dataset with 14 410 xray image verify performance proposed approach result demonstrate benefit saliency based folding approach that delivers comparable classification accuracy with state art but exhibit lower computational cost storage requirement factor highly important big data analytics
