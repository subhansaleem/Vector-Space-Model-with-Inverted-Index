lsh v randomized partition tree which one use nearest neighbor search nearest neighbor search rp tree recently randomized partition tree been theoretically shown cite dasgupta13 very effective performing high dimensional nearest neighbor search this paper introduce variant randomized partition tree high dimensional nearest neighbor search problem provide theoretical justification it choice experiment various real life datasets show that this new variant performs better than variant introduced cite dasgupta13 also than locality sensitive hashing lsh method nearest neighbor search addition show an interesting connection between various notion difficulty nearest neighbor search problem that recently been introduced namely potential function cite dasgupta13 relative contrast cite he12
