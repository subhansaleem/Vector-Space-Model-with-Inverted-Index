classification evolving data stream with infinitely delayed label data stream classification delayed label extreme verification latency online clustering majority evolving data stream classification algorithm assume that actual label predicted example readily available without any time delay just after prediction made however given high label cost dependence an expert limitation data transmission or even restriction imposed by problem s nature there large number real world application which availability actual label infinitely delayed never available these case it necessary use algorithm that doe not follow traditional process monitoring error rate detect change data distribution us most recent labeled data update classification model this paper propose method mclassification classify evolving data stream with infinitely delayed label our method inspired use micro cluster representation from online clustering algorithm considering presence incremental drift our approach us distance based strategy maintain micro cluster position updated an evaluation several synthetic real data show that mclassification achieves competitive accuracy result state art method adequate computational cost main advantage proposed method absence critical parameter that require user s prior knowledge occurs with rival method
