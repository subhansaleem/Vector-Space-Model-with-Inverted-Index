an emd based method reduction ballistocardiogram artifact from eeg study evoked potential ballistocardiogram artifact simultaneous eeg fmri event related potential empirical mode decomposition multi modality data acquisition topic research that gained interest recent year it provides opportunity gather detailed information analysis simultaneous electroencephalography eeg functional magnetic resonance imaging one good example it information get after fusing data from eeg fmri both high temporal spatial resolution other side this eeg recording suffers from some additional artifact due fmri environment particular ballistocardiogram artifact this article new method removing ballistocardiogram artifact from evoked potential study proposed method doe not require any reference signal or prior information result presented using data three subject volunteer result show that proposed method efficiently reduce ballistocardiogram artifact performed better compared conventional method
