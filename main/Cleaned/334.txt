differentiation integration machine learning feature vector kernel method classification gene coexpression network cancer this paper present new approach production feature map improvement classification machine learning idea based calculus differentiation integration feature vector which viewed function metric space or network based this propose novel network based binary machine learning classifier illustrate our method using molecular network alone distinguish phenotype including cancer type subtypes include feature set derived from disease specific gene co expression network different cancer data set using cancer genome atlas tcga along with other previously published study also illustrate our network based predictor another data type based infrared spectroscopy lung cancer tissue
