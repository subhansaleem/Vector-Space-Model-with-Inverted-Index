extending soft set towards optimality decision based multiple decision over same data decision making fuzzy logic soft set fuzzy operation soft set integrated with fuzzy logic this paper this research work further extends cagman s work soft set it make parametric value associated with every individual object extended soft set fuzzy form this increase decision capability soft set approach distinguish one object from another based their fuzzy parameter value further prove several fuzzy soft operation based new concept furthermore provide concept row operation which describes product soft set with fuzzy parameter value then sum operation row product construct decision making approach this increase capability multiple decision maker same data reach final selection based their individual conclusion
