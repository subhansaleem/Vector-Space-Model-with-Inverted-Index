anomaly detection multivariate non stationary time series automatic dbms diagnosis anomaly detection non stationary time series automatic diagnosis reconstruction error statistical process control transfer learning anomaly detection database management system dbms difficult because increasing number statistic stat event metric big data system this paper i propose an automatic dbms diagnosis system that detects anomaly period with abnormal db stat metric find causal event period reconstruction error from deep autoencoder statistical process control approach applied detect time period with anomaly related event found using time series similarity measure between event abnormal stat metric after training deep autoencoder with dbms metric data efficacy anomaly detection investigated from other dbms containing anomaly experiment result show effectiveness proposed model especially batch temporal normalization layer proposed model used publishing automatic dbms diagnosis report order determine dbms configuration sql tuning
