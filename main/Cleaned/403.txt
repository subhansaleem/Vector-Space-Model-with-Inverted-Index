new approach segment hemorrhagic stroke computed tomography via optimum path snake active contour method optimum path forest snake image segmentation this work present new approach segment hemorrhagic stroke based an active contour method called optimum path snake ops analysis human tissue density ahtd wa introduced evolution pulmonary density analysis feature extractor result this approach were compared with region growing watershed level set based coherent propagation method segment stroke region accuracy matthew correlation coefficient dice coefficient hausdorff distance harmonic mean metric were used verify efficacy ops over other method ops method along with ahtd extractor presented best result which demonstrated potential this approach used medical diagnosis system
