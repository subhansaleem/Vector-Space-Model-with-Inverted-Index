an analysis instance selection neural network improve training speed instance selection neural network training speed training artificial neural network ann relatively slow compared many other machine learning algorithm this study focus instance selection improve training speed first evaluate effectiveness instance selection algorithm k nearest neighbor algorithm with ann then analyze factor accuracy distance from decision boundary dense region class distribution propose new instance selection algorithm discus tradeoff between accuracy training speed introduce measure tradeoff our empirical result real data set indicate that our proposed rdi more effective with ann
