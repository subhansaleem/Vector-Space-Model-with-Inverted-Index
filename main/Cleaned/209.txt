learning complex event from sequence with informed gap complex event programming frequent sequence pattern mining constraint programming complex event processing key technology current business which sequence event controlled however defining complex event not easy sequence learning algorithm help that end sequence learning method should consider temporal relationship among event this paper tackle problem mining complex event using frequent sequence pattern mining with time gap constraint model learning problem proposed consistently learning problem addressed using solver off shelf experiment carried out bike hiring domain so cep system account how many user will reach depot independently which wa their origin result analysed term individual multiple user well regarding scalability method
