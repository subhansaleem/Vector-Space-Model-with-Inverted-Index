efficient rotation invariant fingerprint matching algorithm using adjustment factor minutia bifurcation ridge afis fingerprint minutia code this paper present new efficient rotation invariant algorithm that make use local feature forfingerprint matching minutia point first extracted from afingerprint image minutia code mc defined this paper then generated each extracted minutia point proposed minutia code invariant rotation fingerprint image adjustment factor af introduced address problem due difference claimant fingerprint template fingerprint same person that may present due variation inking or variation pressure applied between finger scanner adjustment factor calculated from minutia code mc two fingerprint being matched two stage fingerprint matching process proposed during first stage only few minutia code checked decide if second stage matching process required this make matching process faster proposed strategy tested number publicly available image db1 fvc2004 database result promising
