an accurate fast embedded feature selection svms rfe feature selection embedded method support vector machine recursive feature addition feature selection still vital area research machine learning field after emergence big data need mining large data size increased provide faster more accurate prediction feature selection concerned with selecting most important feature from set input feature since some datasets may contain irrelevant or redundant feature this paper new feature selection method type embedded presented discussed with some preliminary result using existing benchmark datasets new method called recursive feature addition which work forward fashion based support vector machine new method been applied five different benchmark datasets which it shown superior performance term accuracy time compared filter wrapper other embedded method
