dynamic inclusion new event type visual inspection using evolving classifier expected change classifier s accuracy visual inspection new event type integration new class fly evolving fuzzy classifier this paper dealing with automatic inclusion new event type visual inspection system within context image classification recognizing ok not ok part certain event directly associated with class event usually independent disjoint from each other this sense dealing with problem integrating new class into image classifier fly specified line by an operator using evolving fuzzy classifier efc which relying fuzzy rule base able adapt their structure update their parameter incremental manner novel methodological aspect lie 1 appropriate structural change efc whenever new class appears 2 estimation expected change classifier accuracy older class seen before which based an analysis expected change classifier s decision boundary second point an important aspect operator they already familiar work with established classifier that some accuracy classification new concept will evaluated real world visual inspection scenario where main task classify event type which may occur micro fluidic chip may lead deterioration their quality
