robust kernel embedding conditional posterior distribution with application bayesian inference zero shot learning kernel method this paper proposes novel non parametric method robustly embed conditional posterior distribution reproducing kernel hilbert space rkhs robust embedding obtained by eigenvalue decomposition rkhs by retaining only leading eigenvectors noise data methodically disregarded non parametric conditional posterior distribution embedding obtained by our method applied wide range bayesian inference problem this paper apply it heterogeneous face recognition zero shot object recognition problem experimental validation show that our method produce better result than comparative algorithm
