local global data spread based index determining number cluster dataset number cluster dataset cluster validity clustering compactness measure cluster distinctness measure cluster most clustering algorithm sensitive input parameter produce different clustering result different input parameter same datasets number method index been proposed validating result clustering process most commonly used approach cluster validation based internal index this paper propose new cluster validity index arspread index purpose cluster validation determining number cluster present dataset local global data spread based approach proposed measure compactness cluster distinctness measure that based penalty function incorporated proposed index conduct thorough comparison five commonly known index with proposed index provide summary experimental performance different index experimental result show that proposed new index performs better than commonly known index
