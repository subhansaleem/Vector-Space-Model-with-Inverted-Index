wifi localization mobile robot based random forest gplvm wifi slam mobile robot random forest gplvm khepera proliferation wifi network attracted many research community employ wifi signal estimating location mobile device indoor environment this paper propose localization framework that capable determining location mobile robot indoor limited area proposed framework exploit random forest algorithm both classification regression technique which used build cooperated supervised localization model localization model trained offline based training data that contains measurement wifi signal strength location these measurement also proposed an extension our framework using gaussian process latent variable model gplvm which give our framework ability build subjective localization model which don t require any prior knowledge about ground truth localization place our experimental evaluation proposed framework using kheperaiii mobile robot one testbed show that it give high accuracy where calculated mean localization error 36 cm
