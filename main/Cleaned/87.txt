incremental svd insight into wind generation vector matrix decomposition approximation method singular value decomposition wind speed this paper formulate problem predicting wind generation one streaming data analysis want understand if it possible use weather data time window just before current time gain insight into how wind generation might behave time interval just after current time specifically use singular value decomposition weather data how that number singular value largest singular value used predict magnitude change generation near future analysis us an incremental algorithm based sliding window reduced computational cost
