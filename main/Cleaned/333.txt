feature fusion denoising sparse autoencoders application neuroimaging data deep learning alzheimer s disease stage detection feature fusion sacked sparse autoencoders stacked denoising autoencoders although there cure date alzheimer s disease detection early stage significant impact patient s life term cost progress helping plan advance an appropriate healthcare life ahead well providing clinical etiology further research this paper discus implementing feature fusion method utilizing sparse denoising autoencoders reveal stage alzheimer s disease four cohort consisted individual with alzheimer s disease late mild cognitive impairment early mild cognitive impairment normal control group classified using multinomial logistic regression fueled by fusion high level low level feature high level feature extracted from stacked autoencoders result show that feature fusion enhance performance typical autoencoders however performance feature fusion using denoising autoencoders superior that sparse training autoencoders term overall accuracy precision recall
