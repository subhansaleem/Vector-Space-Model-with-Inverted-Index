improving performance problem with few labelled data by reusing stacked auto encoders transfer learning deep learning artificial neural network deep architecture been used transfer learning application with aim improving performance network designed given problem by reusing knowledge from another problem this work addressed transfer knowledge between deep network used classifier digit shape image considering case where only set class label or only data distribution changed from source target problem our main goal wa study how performance knowledge transfer between such problem would affected by varying number layer being retrained amount data used that retraining generally reusing network trained different label set led better result than reusing network trained different data distribution particular reusing le class network trained more class wa beneficial virtually any amount training data case retraining only one layer save time consistently led poorer performance result obtained when retraining upright digit network trained rotated digit raise hypothesis that transfer learning could used better deal with image classification problem which only small amount labelled data available training
