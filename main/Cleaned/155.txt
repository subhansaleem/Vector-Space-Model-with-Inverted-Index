effective user authentication using keystroke dynamic based feature selection keystroke dynamic keystroke feature security authentication biometrics efficient keystroke authentication system should ability capture build user s pattern minimal time these system also should able achieve quickest detection while maintaining good detection accuracy however maintaining high detection accuracy minimal detection delay conflicting requirement that need balanced possible approach tackle this problem reducing number feature that need learned by classifier thereby decreasing processing time wrapper based feature subset selection approach presented this paper with objective reducing dimensionality user data through identifying smaller subset feature that represent most discriminating feature keystroke dynamic several feature selection technique such genetic greedy algorithm best first search algorithm particle swarm optimization pso used search best subset feature these selection technique integrated wrapped with different machine learning classifier namely support vector machine svm naive bayesian nb k nearest neighbor knn feature subset selection procedure that automatically select most appropriate representative subset feature
