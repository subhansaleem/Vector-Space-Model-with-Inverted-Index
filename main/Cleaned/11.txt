activity recognition using graphical feature smart environment activity recognition graph representation activity recognition important order facilitate elderly resident their caregiver need this problem been widely investigated using different method including probabilistic markovian approach focus this paper perform activity recognition more accuractely than existing approach represent motion sensor smart environment graph resident movement edge graph then graph based feature extracted used input support vector machine these feature been combined with motion sensor based feature this method been compared with three other widely used approach naive bayes hidden markov model hmm conditional random field crf three different datasets from three smart aparments case method based graphical feature outpeformed existing approach
