zero shot deep learning from semantic attribute semantics training estimation neural network taxonomy visualization support vector machine study problem classifying image when training exemplar available some image class therefore direct classification not possible use instead semantic attribute if attribute yet unseen class determined then class label may themselves decided based prior knowledge class attribute relationship present several method determining attribute including an approach based attribute classifier approach using b map c mmse attribute estimator using image classifier known class preliminary test obtained using dataset comprised imagenet image human218 attribute yield encouraging performance
