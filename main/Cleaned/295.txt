temporal link prediction using time series quasi local node similarity measure social network analysis evolving network node similarity link prediction narx neural network evolving network which composed object relationship that change over time prevalent many real world domain become an significant research topic recent year most previous link prediction study neglect evolution network over time mainly focus predicting future link based static feature node link however real world network complex dynamic structure non linear varying topological feature which mean that both node link network may appear or disappear these dynamicity network make link prediction more challenging task overcome these difficulty link prediction such network must model nonlinear temporal evolution topological feature link occurrence information network structure simultaneously this article propose novel link prediction method based narx neural network evolving network our model first calculates similarity score based quasi local measure each pair node different snapshot network create time series each pair then narx network effectively applied prediction future node similarity score by using past node similarity node connectivity proposed method tested dblp coauthorship network it shown that combining time information with node similarity node connectivity improves link prediction performance large extent
