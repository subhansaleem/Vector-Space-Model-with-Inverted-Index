using spectral feature improve sentiment analysis feature discovery spectral learning discrete fourier sentiment analysis common approach sentiment classification identify set sentiment carrying word then use machine learning build classifier that classify sentiment based presence absence those word this paper propose fourier based extension this approach specifically introduce spectral learning algorithm that implicitly identifies sentiment carrying word higher order function those word it learns assign real valued sentiment score document spectral learner extends word presence model by applying boolean logic operator or xor word presence feature identify useful higher order feature these spectral feature used other learning algorithm show how performance other learning algorithm improved by these feature finally consider problem determining which pair review express more positive overall sentiment show that spectral learner identify very small distinction sentiment with better than random accuracy while larger distinction correctly identified with high accuracy
