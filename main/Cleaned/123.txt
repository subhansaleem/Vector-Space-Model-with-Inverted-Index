family chisini mean based jensen shannon divergence kernel jensen shannon divergence kernel libs jensen shannon divergence an effective method measuring distance between two probability distribution when difference between these two distribution subtle jensen shannon divergence doe not provide adequate separation draw distinction from subtly different distribution extend jensen shannon divergence by reformulating it using alternate operator that provide different property concerning robustness furthermore prove number important property this extension lower limit it range it relationship shannon entropy kullback leibler divergence finally propose family new kernel based chisini mean jensen shannon divergence demonstrate it utility providing better svm classification accuracy over rbf kernel amino acid spectrum because spectral method capture phenomenon subatomic level difference between complex compound often subtle while impetus behind this work began with spectral data method generally applicable domain where subtle difference important
