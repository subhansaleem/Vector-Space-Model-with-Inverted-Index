integrating active learning with supervision crowdsourcing generalization crowdsourcing active learning supervised classification with various online crowdsourcing platform it easy collect multiple label same example from crowd consensus integration algorithm infer estimated ground truth from multiple label set these crowdsourcing datasets however it couldn t avoided that these integrated estimated label still contain noise order further improve performance model learned from data with these integrated label propose an active learning framework further improve data quality such that improve model quality through acquiring limited true label from expert oracle further investigate two active learning strategy term two uncertainty measure i e clue mue within active learning framework from our experimental result eight simulation crowdsourcing datasets four real world crowdsourcing datasets with three popular consensus integration algorithm draw several conclusion follows i our active learning framework with input from oracle significantly improves generalization ability model learned from crowdsourcing data ii our two active learning strategy outperform random active learning strategy
