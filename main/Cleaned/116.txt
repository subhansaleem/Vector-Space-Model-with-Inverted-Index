statistical learning via manifold learning statistical learning manifold learning tangent bundle manifold learning manifold learning regression new geometrically motivated method proposed solving non linear regression task consisting constructing predictive function which estimate an unknown smooth mapping f from q dimensional input m dimensional output based given input output training pair unknown mapping f determines q dimensional regression manifold m f consisting q m dimensional input output vector manifold covered by single chart training data set determines manifold valued sample from this manifold modern manifold learning technique used constructing certain estimator m regression manifold from sample which accurately approximates regression manifold proposed method called manifold learning regression mlr find predictive function fmlr ensure an equality m fmlr m mlr estimate also m q jacobian matrix mapping f
