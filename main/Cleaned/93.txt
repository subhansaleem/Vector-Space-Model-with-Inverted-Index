novel bayesian network based scheme finding optimal solution stochastic online equi partitioning problem bayes method partitioning algorithm meteorology noise stochastic process convergence probabilistic logic number intriguing decision scenario such order picking revolve around partitioning collection object so optimize some application specific objective function it general form this problem referred object partitioning problem oop known np hard here consider variant opp namely stochastic online equi partitioning problem so epp so epp object arrive sequentially pair relationship between arriving object pair stochastic they belong same partition with probability p from history object arrival goal predict which object will appear together future arrival an additional complication partition related object required equal cardinality decision maker however not informed about true relation between object he merely observing stream object pair predict future behavior inferring correct partitioning from historical behavior thus significant challenge which becomes even more difficult when p unknown previously only heuristic sub optimal solution strategy been proposed so epp this paper propose first it optimal solution strategy brief scheme that propose bn epp founded bayesian network representation so epp problem based probabilistic reasoning not only able infer correct object partitioning with optimal accuracy also able simultaneously infer p allowing u accelerate learning object pair arrive being optimal bn epp provides superior performance compared existing state art solution scheme bn epp also highly flexible being capable encoding object partitioning constraint finally bn epp parameter free it performance doe not rely fine tuning any parameter result these advantage bn epp open significantly improved performance oop based application
