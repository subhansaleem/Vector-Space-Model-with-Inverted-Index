time sensitive adaptation regularization strength recurrent neural network accurate learning recurrent neural network long short term memory regularization time varying impact penalization regularization an important issue neural network because strong expression power causing overfitting data regularization method penalize cost function by activation based penalty it application recurrent neural network method usually assigns penalty uniformly distributed over time step however required strength recurrent network differs by time step this paper propose new activation based penalty function varying it strength over time step recurrent neural network verify it impact conducted practical experiment predict power consumption home appliance result proposed method reduced training error maintained validation test error which implies improvement forecasting ability sensitivity analysis method restricted sudden decrease impact early time step cost
