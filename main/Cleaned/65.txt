uncertainty quantified matrix completion using bayesian hierarchical matrix factorization bayesian analysis probabilistic matrix factorization uncertainty quantification low rank matrix completion method been successful variety setting such recommendation system however most existing matrix completion method only provide point estimate missing entry not characterize uncertainty prediction this paper propose bayesian hierarchical probabilistic matrix factorization bhpmf model 1 incorporate hierarchical side information 2 provide uncertainty quantified prediction former yield significant performance improvement problem plant trait prediction key problem ecology by leveraging taxonomic hierarchy plant kingdom latter helpful identifying prediction low confidence which turn used guide field work data collection effort gibbs sampler designed inference model further propose multiple inheritance bhpmf mi bhpmf which work with general directed acyclic graph dag structured hierarchy rather than tree present comprehensive experimental result problem plant trait prediction using largest database plant trait where bhpmf show strong empirical performance uncertainty quantified trait prediction outperforming state art based point estimate further show that bhpmf more accurate when it confident whereas error high when uncertainty high
