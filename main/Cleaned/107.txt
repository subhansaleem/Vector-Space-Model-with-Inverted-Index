coordinate descent fuzzy twin support vector machine classification coordinate descent fuzzy active set shrinking high dimensional input tsvm svm this paper develop novel coordinate descent fuzzy twin svm cdftsvm classification proposed cdftsvm not only inherits advantage twin svm but also lead rapid robust classification result specifically our cdftsvm two distinguished advantage 1 an effective fuzzy membership function produced removing noise incurred by contaminant input 2 coordinate descent strategy with shrinking by active set used deal with computational complexity brought by high dimensional input addition series simulation experiment conducted verify performance cdftsvm which further support our previous claim
