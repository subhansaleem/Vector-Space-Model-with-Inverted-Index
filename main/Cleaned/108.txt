self configuring evolving fuzzy image thresholding evolving fuzzy system image segmentation thresholding medical image analysis every segmentation algorithm parameter that need adjusted order achieve good result evolving fuzzy system adjustment segmentation parameter been proposed recently evolving fuzzy image segmentation efis 1 however similar any other algorithm efis too suffers from few limitation when used practice major drawback efis depends detection object interest feature calculation task that highly application dependent this paper new version efis proposed overcome these limitation new efis called self configuring efis sc efis us available training data auto configure parameter that fixed efis well proposed scefis relies feature selection process that doe not require detection region interest roi
