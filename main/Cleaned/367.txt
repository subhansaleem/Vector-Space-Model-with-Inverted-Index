online structure search sum product network sum product network exact inference online learning variety algorithm exist learning both structure parameter sum product network spns class probabilistic model which exact inference done quickly vast majority them batch learner including recently proposed algorithm searchspn however searchspn property that make it particularly suited adaptation online setting this paper introduce onlinesearchspn algorithm which doe just that compare it two general method that build online learner from batch learner one learns poor model quickly other learns good model slowly our experiment show that onlinesearchspn achieves best both method test likelihood value model it learns good slow learner while training time needed learn model much closer fast learner
