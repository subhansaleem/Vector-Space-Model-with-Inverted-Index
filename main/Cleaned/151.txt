detection ssh brute force attack using aggregated netflow data intrusion detection brute force machine learning aggregated netflows ssh brute force attack one most prevalent attack computer network these attack aim gain ineligible access user account by trying plenty different password combination detection this type attack network level overcome scalability issue host based detection method this paper provide machine learning approach detection ssh brute force attack network level since extracting discriminative feature any machine learning task fundamental step explain process extracting discriminative feature detection brute force attack incorporate domain knowledge about ssh brute force attack well analysis representative collection data define feature collected real ssh traffic from campus network also generated some failed login data that legitimate user who forgotten password produce normal traffic that similar ssh brute force attack traffic our inspection collected brute force netflow data manually produced ssh failed login data showed that netflow feature not discriminative enough discern brute force traffic from failed login traffic produced by legitimate user introduced an aggregation netflows extract proper feature building machine learning model our result show that model built upon these feature provide excellent performance detection brute force attack
