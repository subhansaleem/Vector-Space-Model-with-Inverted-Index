adventure game with neural network controlled non playing character neural network genetic algorithm web based game neuroevolution this paper present way evolve non playing character by controlling it through neural network then using genetic algorithm alter weight previous neural network data provides population from which select individual simulated result allow relative ranking that use fitness function treating selected set neural network weight binary sequence program us cross over mutation create new set weight which subsequently evaluated through this process find that program creates better set neural network weight that relative ranking allow computer controlled character range difficulty level implement this experiment part game
