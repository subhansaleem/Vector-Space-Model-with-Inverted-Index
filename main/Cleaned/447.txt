predicting psychosis using experience sampling method with mobile apps predicting psychosis esm mhealth svm gaussian process random forest neural network feature selection roc analysis monte carlo smart phone become ubiquitous recent year which opened new opportunity rediscovering experience sampling method esm new efficient form using mobile apps provides great prospect become low cost high impact mhealth tool psychiatry practice method used collect longitudinal data participant daily life experience ideal capture fluctuation emotion momentary mental state an early indicator later mental health disorder this study esm data patient with psychosis control were used examine emotion change identify pattern this paper attempt determine whether aggregated esm data which statistical measure represent distribution dynamic original data able distinguish patient from control variable importance recursive feature elimination relieff method were used feature selection model training tuning testing were performed nested cross validation were based algorithm such random forest support vector machine gaussian process logistic regression neural network roc analysis wa used post process these model stability model performance wa studied using monte carlo simulation result provide evidence that pattern mood change captured with combination technique used best result were achieved by svm with radial kernel where best model performed with 82 accuracy 82 sensitivity
