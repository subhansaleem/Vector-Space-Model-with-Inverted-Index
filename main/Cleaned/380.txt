deep transductive nonnegative matrix factorization speech separation nonnegative matrix factorization deep learning transductive learning speech separation non negative matrix factorization nmf attracted great attention speech separation it preserve non negativity property magnitude spectrogram speech signal however nmf sometimes performs poorly because it not extract non linear feature speech this paper propose deep transductive nmf model dtnmf which incorporates multi layer structure into nmf learns shared dictionary source signal each speaker mixture signal separated since multi layer structure enables dtnmf learn more precise presentation source signal with non linear feature extracted dtnmf significantly enhances performance speech separation experimental result non negative matrix factorization nmf attracted great attention speech separation it preserve non negativity property magnitude spectrogram speech signal however nmf sometimes performs poorly because it not extract non linear feature speech this paper propose deep transductive nmf model dtnmf which incorporates multi layer structure into nmf learns shared dictionary source signal each speaker mixture signal separated since multi layer structure enables dtnmf learn more precise presentation source signal with non linear feature extracted dtnmf significantly enhances performance speech separation experimental result popular librispeech dataset show that dtnmf outperforms representative nmf model separating mixture single channel speech signal
