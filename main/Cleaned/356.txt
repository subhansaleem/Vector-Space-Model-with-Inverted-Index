home appliance energy disaggregation using low frequency data machine learning classifier smart energy smart housing disaggregation non intrusive load monitoring neural network feature selection home appliance monitoring provides useful information about appliance usage which used better inform user about their consumption habit promote energy conservation however metering load cost prohibitive instead many tried disaggregate load from aggregate power measurement existing approach that require submetering high resolution power signal individual appliance during training testing impractical economically infeasible this paper introduce low cost approach home appliance monitoring based observation made single circuit our approach consists three step first apply neural network classifier segment input power signal then apply another classifier label each segment an individual appliance or multiple appliance finally iteratively disaggregate multi appliance segment with classifier previous step our proposed approach evaluated two experiment first experiment us fully labeled public dataset consisting 1 211 segment from 25 student bedroom university campus second experiment us 1 563 segment from redd public dataset evaluation show that our approach accurately detect those appliance that dominate energy consumption overall accuracy 86 6 91 2 respectively also present an depth analysis failure conjecture why they harder detect
