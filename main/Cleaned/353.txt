attribute assisted interpretation confidence classification using machine learning self organizing map interpretation uncertainty support vector machine learning an attribute assisted classification deriving estimate interpretation confidence wa performed instantaneous coherency attribute were used supervised followed by an unsupervised classification resulting an error envelope interpretation an initial approximation confidence weight signal background response estimated using support vector machine learning subsequently weighted discrimination based several coherency attribute using self organizing map obtained resulting quantization used additional input constraint final probability assessment signal confidence using instantaneous attribute support vector machine learning additional input form quantization vector possible reduction dimensionality input attribute vector space allows combine highly non linear correlation multivariate discrimination trained classification used assign signal confidence probability an interpreted seismic horizon proposed methodology applied an onshore data set from wyoming usa revealing how single multi trace attribute used quantitatively ass uncertainty an interpretation often lost during project maturation
