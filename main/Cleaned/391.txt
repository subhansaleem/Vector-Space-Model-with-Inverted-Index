eyequal accurate explainable retinal image quality assessment weakly supervised learning multiple instance learning medical image analysis retinal image quality assessment given retinal image automatically determine whether it high quality suitable medical diagnosis also explain our decision pinpointing region or region that led our decision image from human retina vital diagnosis multiple health issue like hypertension diabetes alzheimer s low quality image may force patient come back again second scanning wasting time possibly delaying treatment however existing retinal image quality assessment method either black box without explanation result or depend heavily feature engineering or complex error prone anatomical structure segmentation therefore propose eyequal that solves exactly this problem eyequal novel fast inference accurate explainable pinpointing low quality region image evaluated eyequal two real datasets where it achieved 100 accuracy taking just 36 millisecond each image
