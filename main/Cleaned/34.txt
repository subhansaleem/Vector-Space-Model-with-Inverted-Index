post processing association rule using network transductive learning network association rule pruning post processing label propagation association widely used find relation among item given database however finding interesting pattern challenging task due large number rule that generated traditionally this task done by post processing approach that explore direct user interesting rule domain some these approach use user s knowledge guide exploration according what defined thought interesting by user however this definition done before process start therefore user must know what may what may not interesting him this work proposes general association rule post processing approach that extract user s knowledge during post processing phase that way user doe not need prior knowledge database that proposed approach model association rule network us it measure suggest rule classified by user then propagates these classification entire network using transductive learning algorithm therefore this approach treat post processing problem classification task experiment were carried out demonstrate that proposed approach reduces number rule explored by user directs him potentially interesting rule domain
