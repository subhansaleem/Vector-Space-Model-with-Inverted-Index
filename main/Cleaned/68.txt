better case adaptation method case based effort estimation using multi objective optimization multi objective particle swarm optimization case based reasoning adaptation method software effort estimation case based reasoning cbr considered one efficient method area software effort estimation because it outstanding performance capability handling noisy datasets this study examines performance multi objective particle swarm optimization algorithm find best configuration parameter adaptation process particularly propose new adaptation method which it parameter optimized by making trade off between multiple accuracy measure proposed adaptation fully automated able dynamically adapt each case dataset individually based empirical validation over 8 datasets performance figure seen good improvement against conventional cbr some adapted version cbr
