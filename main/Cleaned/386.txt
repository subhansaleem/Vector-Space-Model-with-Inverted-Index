stacking method hierarchical classification hierarchical classification bioinformatics stacking hierarchical classification hc consists classification problem whose class structured hierarchical fashion many problem addressed by hc special decent amount work dealt with bioinformatics related problem such protein function prediction pfp transposable element te classification both them still challenging task hc due noisy imbalanced nature datasets countermeasure stacking an ensemble method capable generalizing knowledge from many classifier this work propose three stacking method hc evaluate it performance pfp te datasets our result show that when compared regular stacking state art method from literature our method able obtain superior or competitive performance
