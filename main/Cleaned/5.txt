concept drift awareness twitter stream twitter adaptation model time frequency analysis event detection context vector learning non stationary environment not an easy task requires distinctive approach learning model must not only ability continuously learn but also ability change already acquired concept additionally given significant importance that social network gained information network there an ever growing interest extraction complex information used trend detection promoting service or market sensing this dynamic nature tends limit performance traditional static learning model dynamic learning strategy must put forward this paper present learning strategy learn presence concept drift twitter propose three different model time window model an ensemble based model an incremental model since little known about type drift that occur twitter simulate different type drift by artificially timestamping real twitter message order evaluate validate our strategy result so far encouraging regarding learning presence drift along with classifying message twitter stream
