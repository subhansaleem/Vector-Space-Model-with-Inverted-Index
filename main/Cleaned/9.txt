line signature verification using symbolic aggregate approximation sax sequential minimal optimization smo signature discretize unordered classification training bag pattern signature single most widely used method identifying an individual but they carry with them an alarmingly significant amount vulnerability implying need an effective robust method precisely identifying an individual signature signature an individual visually acquired by using pen based tracking system 1 2 this paper considers possibility discretizing visually acquired signature represent them an unordered collection word then use sequential mining optimization smo training support vector machine svm classify signature either legitimate or forged discretizing signature done by using symbolic aggregate approximation sax 4 sax reduces dimension signature produce list sax word which then represented bag pattern model classification purpose 5 data set consisted more than 3960 signature 106 subject distributed across two set result obtained provided good classification accuracy additionally provided an insight into unique pattern each subject signature
