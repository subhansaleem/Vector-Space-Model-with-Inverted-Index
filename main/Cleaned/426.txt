component based architecture control crossing region railway network control system component based design petri net railway crossing region research work this paper discus an improved petri net model railway crossing region which important critical component railway network control algorithm been developed showing interaction controller other component system formal approach viz petri net pn applied model safety requirement train along crossing region railway network modeling component based modeling state oriented modeling approach been integrated first track component control component identified interaction identified component satisfying safety requirement also defined high level architecture finally state oriented modeling approach been adopted design detailed model crossing region further this paper us coverability tree verify specification crossing region by taking crossing point center circular region introduced safety purpose further safety property been defined term place invariant which been verified by state space analysis
