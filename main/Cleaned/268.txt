android malware detection building useful representation malware classification logistic regression random projection android dimensionality reduction feature selection problem proactively detecting android malware proven challenging one challenge stem from variety issue but recent literature shown that this task hard solve with high accuracy when only restricted set feature like permission or similar fixed set feature used opposite approach including available feature also problematic it cause feature space grow beyond reasonable size this paper focus finding an efficient way select representative feature space preserving it discriminative power unseen data go beyond traditional approach like principal component analysis which too heavy large scale problem with million feature particular show that many feature group that extracted from android application package like feature extracted from manifest file or string extracted from dalvik executable dex should filtered used classification separately our proposed dimensionality reduction scheme applied each group separately consists raw string preprocessing feature selection via log odds finally applying random projection with size feature space growing exponentially function training set s size our approach drastically decrease size feature space several order magnitude this turn allows accurate classification become possible real world scenario after reducing dimensionality use feature group light weight ensemble logistic classifier evaluated proposed classification scheme real malware data provided by antivirus vendor achieved state art 88 24 true positive reasonably low 0 04 false positive rate with significantly compressed feature space balanced test set 10 000 sample
