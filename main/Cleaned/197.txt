car following markov regime classification calibration car following model regime classification model calibration driver behavior markov switching model car following behavior recently gained much attention due it wide variety application this includes accident analysis driver assessment support system road design this paper present model that leverage markov regime switching model classify various car following regime detected car following regime then mined calibrate parameter driver dependent driver s current driving regime two stage markov regime switching model utilized detect different car following regime first stage discriminates normal car following regime from abnormal one while second stage classifies normal car following regime their fine grained regime like braking accelerating standing free flowing normal following genetic algorithm then employed observed driver data each car following regime optimize car following model parameter value driver each regime experimental evaluation proposed model using real dataset show that it detect normal rare short time event addition it infer switching process dynamic such expected duration probability moving from one regime another switching parameter each regime finally model able accurately calibrate parameter driver according their driving regime so achieve better understanding driver behavior better simulation driving situation
