an interval radial algorithm hierarchical clustering analysis hierarchical clustering interval radial algorithm efficiency flexibility hierarchical clustering analysis hca produce structure that more informative than an unstructured set cluster however advantage come cost lower efficiency analyzing large dataset with hca it important improve it efficiency motivated by fact that small quantitative difference may not necessarily reflect change qualitative property report an interval radial algorithm hca by grouping data point within neighborhood interval radial algorithm o n 2 both agglomerative divisive approach under an easy satisfy weak condition algorithm adaptively adjust radius during it execution furthermore algorithm provides flexibility user them select initial radius step size such that produce customized output automatically report algorithm it analysis result computational experiment several benchmark datasets example illustrative dendrograms included
