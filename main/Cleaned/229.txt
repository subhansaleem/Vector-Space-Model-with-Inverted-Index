superposed naive bayes accurate interpretable prediction naive bayes classifier bagging boosting ensemble method model transformatiomn performance interpretability background data mining machine learning technique been widely applied software engineering research however past research mainly focused only prediction accuracy aim interpretability prediction result should accorded greater emphasis software engineering research prediction model that high accuracy explanatory power required method propose new algorithm naïve bayes ensemble called superposed naïve bayes snb which firstly build an ensemble model with high prediction accuracy then transforms it into an interpretable naïve bayes model result conducted an experiment with nasa mdp datasets which performance interpretability proposed method were compared with those other classification technique result experiment indicate that proposed method produce balanced output that satisfy both performance interpretability criterion conclusion confirmed effectiveness proposed method an experiment using software defect data model extensively applied other application area where both performance interpretability required
