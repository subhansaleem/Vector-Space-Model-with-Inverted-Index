feedforward neural network predicting duration maintained software project software engineering software maintenance duration prediction multilayer feedforward neural network statistical regression isbsg software project been developed delivered any modification it corresponds maintenance software maintenance sm involves modification keep software project usable changed or changing environment reactive modification correct discovered fault modification improve performance or maintainability since duration sm should predicted this study after statistical analysis project maintained several platform programming language generation data set were selected training testing multilayer feedforward neural network i e multilayer perceptron mlp these data set were obtained from international software benchmarking standard group result based wilcoxon statistical test show that prediction accuracy with mlp statistically better than that with statistical regression model when software project were maintained 1 mid range platform coded programming language third generation 2 multi platform coded programming language fourth generation
