multi period prediction solar radiation using arma arima model solar radiation multi period prediction arma arima due variation weather condition solar power integration electricity grid high penetration rate cause threat grid stability therefore it required predict solar radiation parameter order ensure quality security grid this study initially 1 h time series model belong solar radiation parameter created multi period prediction afterwards autoregressive moving average arma autoregressive integrated moving average arima model compared term goodness fit value produced by log likelihood function result determining best statistical model multi period prediction one period two period three period ahead prediction carried out solar radiation parameter comprehensive way many feasible comparison been made solar radiation prediction
