hybrid scheme fault diagnosis with partially labeled set observation fault diagnosis semi supervised learning bearing defect dimensionality reduction induction motor machine learning technique widely used diagnosing fault guarantee safe reliable operation system among various technique semi supervised learning help diagnosing faulty state decision making partially labeled data where only few number labeled observation along with large number unlabeled observation collected from process thus it crucial conduct critical study use semi supervised technique both dimensionality reduction fault classification this work three state art semi supervised dimensionality reduction technique used produce informative feature semi supervised fault classifier this study aim achieve best pair semisupervised dimensionality reduction classification technique that integrated into diagnostic scheme decision making under partially labeled set observation
