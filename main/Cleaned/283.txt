using domain knowledge feature wind turbine diagnostics feature selection domain knowledge scada data wind turbine fault detection svm fdd mrmr maximising electricity production from wind requires improvement wind turbine reliability component failure result unscheduled or reactive maintenance turbine which incurs significant downtime turn increase production cost ultimately limiting competitiveness renewable energy thus critical task early detection fault this end present framework fault detection using machine learning that us supervisory control data acquisition scada data from large 3mw turbine supplemented with feature derived from this data that encapsulate expert knowledge about wind turbine these new feature created using application domain knowledge that general large horizontal axis wind turbine including knowledge physical quantity measured by sensor approximate location sensor time series behaviour system some statistic related interpretation sensor measurement then use mrmr feature selection select most important these feature new feature set used train support vector machine detect fault classification performance using new feature set compared performance using original feature set use new feature set achieves an f1 score 90 an improvement 27 compared original feature set
