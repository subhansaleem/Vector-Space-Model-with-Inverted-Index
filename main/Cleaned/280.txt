bird call identification using dynamic kernel based support vector machine deep neural network bio acoustic bird call identification dynamic kernel support vector machine deep neural network this paper apply speech audio processing technique bird vocalization classification bird found lower himalayan region mel frequency cepstral coefficient mfcc extracted from each recording result recording now represented varying length set feature vector dynamic kernel based support vector machine svms deep neural network dnns popularly used classification such varying length pattern obtained from speech signal this work propose use dynamic kernel based svms dnns classification bird call represented set feature vector result our study show that both approach give comparable performance
