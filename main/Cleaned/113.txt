study use complexity measure similarity search process adopted by knn algorithm time series prediction time series prediction similarity based method machine learning data mining last two decade with rise data mining process there an increasing interest adaptation machine learning method support time series non parametric modeling prediction non parametric temporal data modeling performed according local global approach most local prediction data strategy based k nearest neighbor knn learning method this paper propose modification knn algorithm time series prediction our proposal differs from literature by incorporating three technique obtaining amplitude offset invariance complexity invariance treatment trivial match evaluate proposed method with six complexity measure order verify impact these measure projection future value besides face our method with two machine learning regression algorithm experimental comparison were performed using 55 data set which available icmc usp time series prediction repository our result indicate that developed method competitive use complexity invariant distance measure generally improves predictive performance
