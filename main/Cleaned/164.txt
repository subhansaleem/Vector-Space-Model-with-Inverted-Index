sequence classification with neural conditional random field hybrid neurocrfs sequence classification proliferation sensor device monitoring human activity generates voluminous amount temporal sequence needing interpreted categorized moreover complex behavior detection requires personalization multi sensor fusion algorithm conditional random field crfs commonly used structured prediction task such part speech tagging natural language processing conditional probability guide choice each tag label sequence conflating structured prediction task with sequence classification task where different model provide different categorization same sequence claim this paper that crf model also provide discriminative model distinguish between type sequence regardless accuracy label obtained if calibrate class membership estimate sequence introduce compare different neural network based linear chain crfs present experiment two complex sequence classification structured prediction task support this claim
