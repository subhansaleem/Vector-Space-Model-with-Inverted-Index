learning score system patient mortality prediction intensive care unit via orthogonal matching pursuit logistic regression intensive care unit mortality rate prediction score system orthogonal matching pursuit problem predicting outcome patient intensive care unit icu great importance critical care medicine wide implication quality control icu dominant approach this problem been use an icu score system such acute physiology chronic health evaluation apache system simplified acute physiology score sap system compute certain severity score patient from set clinical observation apply logistic regression model this score obtain an estimate probability mortality patient owing their simplicity these method widely used by clinician however existing icu score system which built from fixed set patient data often perform poorly when applied patient population with different characteristic also with change patient characteristic score system built from given patient data set becomes suboptimal over time moreover most these score system built using semi automated procedure making it difficult adapt them new patient population thus there huge need adaptive method that automatically learn predictive model from given set patient data indeed there been much work recent year applying various machine learning method this problem however these method learn different representation from score system preferred by clinician this work develop machine learning method based orthogonal matching pursuit that automatically learns score system type model which enjoys benefit both world like other machine learning method it adaptive like standard score system it us representation that easy clinician understand experiment real world patient data set show that our method outperforms standard icu score system performs least well other machine learning method this problem
