variational inference infinite mixture inverse gaussian multinomial probit exponential regression variational inference probit regression exponential regression inverse gaussian regression dirichlet process introduce new class method inference technique infinite mixture inverse gaussian multinomial probit exponential regression model that belong widely applicable framework generalized linear model glm characterize joint distribution response covariates via stick breaking prior this lead various case nonparametric model an infinite mixture inverse gaussian multinomial probit exponential regression estimate localized mean function which map covariates response presented prove weak consistency posterior distribution exponential model sb ex then propose mean field variational inference algorithm inverse gaussian multinomial probit exponential regression finally demonstrate their superior accuracy comparison several other regression model such gaussian process regression dirichlet process regression etc
