hybrid method intrusion detection intrusion detection k nearest neighbor genetic algorithm network attack intrusion detection system id used detect malicious action information system such computing networking system abnormal behavior or activity network system could detected by security system but conventional security system such anti virus firewall not successful many malicious action overcome this problem better more intelligent id solution required this study hybrid approach wa proposed use detect network attack genetic algorithm ga k nearest neighbor knn method were combined model detect attack knn wa employed classify attack ga wa used select k neighbor an attack sample this hybrid system wa first applied intrusion detection field system provides advantage such decreasing dependency full training data set providing plausible solution intrusion detection result showed that proposed system provides better result than single system
