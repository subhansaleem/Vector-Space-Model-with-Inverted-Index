incremental learning decorrelated approximators approximation algorithm algorithm design analysis silicon decorrelation reliability learning system mathematical model general designing an incremental learning system particular task least consists choosing an appropriate approximation structure learning algorithm common linear parameter lip approximation structure example polynomial radial basis function or grid based lookup table typical learning algorithm accompanying them example passive aggressive pa or recursive least square rls usually these two choice not independent not every learning algorithm able handle any approximation structure well here present formalism that allows designer treat these two design aspect independently from each other by decorrelating basis function approximator form new set basis function that handled by any learning algorithm develop design guideline order make our approach an easy use tool support designer making learning progress reliable design time further look property our approach an extension lip approximators investigate it implication behavior incremental learning system using artificial benchmark real world data set regression task
