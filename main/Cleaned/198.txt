gaussian mixture model cluster forest cluster forest clustering ensemble clustering gaussian mixture expectation maximization random forest rf classification algorithm widely used area information retrieval became basis some extended branch classification or regression algorithm cluster forest cf represents particular branch brings usually better result than individual clustering algorithm this article describes new ensemble clustering algorithm based cf that internally us probabilistic model called gaussian mixture model gmm finally expectation maximization algorithm used estimation gmm parameter proposed ensemble clustering algorithm will compared with several different approach tested eight datasets
