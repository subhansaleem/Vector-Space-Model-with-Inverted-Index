deep learning cell classification using microscope image intracellular microtubule network deep learning image classification cell image microtubule cytoskeleton radiality microtubule network mt component cell that may indicate presence various chemical compound used recognize property such treatment resistance therefore classification mt image great relevance cell diagnostics human expert find it particularly difficult recognize level chemical compound exposure cell improving accuracy with automated technique would significant impact cell therapy this paper present application deep learning mt image classification evaluate it large mt image dataset animal cell with three degree exposure chemical agent result demonstrate that learned deep network performs par or better corresponding cell classification task than human expert specifically show that task recognizing different level chemical agent exposure handled significantly better by neural network than by human expert
