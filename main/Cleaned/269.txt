investigating transfer learner robustness domain class imbalance transfer learning domain class imbalance traditional machine learning class imbalance transfer learning environment characterized by machine learning algorithm being trained with data from one domain source domain being tested data from different domain target domain transfer learning scenario class probability source domain may different from class probability target domain which referred domain class imbalance domain class imbalance different from class imbalance class imbalance refers condition single domain having unequal class probability traditional machine learning training testing data drawn from single domain effect class imbalance traditional machine learning well studied however issue domain class imbalance field transfer learning received little research attention this paper provides comparative performance test state art transfer learning algorithm using wide range domain class imbalance combination detailed discussion relative performance different algorithm with statistical validation presented different domain class imbalance scenario
