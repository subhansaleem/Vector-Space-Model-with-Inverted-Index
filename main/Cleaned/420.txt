prediction power grid failure using neural network learning power grid analysis neural network saidi forecast binary classification machine learning application smart city power grid failure potential drastically affect population it localized outage or large scale blackout pre event planning currently consists preparation scenario some enthusiastic prognosis leading most resource spreading thin focus specific area concern typically follows large scale power grid failure post event analysis doe not include an overall analysis this study neural network used conduct pre event analysis power grid determine if it susceptible failure this research study demonstrates that overall pre event analysis beneficial with use machine learning agent agent also used determine area that need most attention future work with larger number constraint additional machine learning algorithm will explored further improve power grid analysis performance
