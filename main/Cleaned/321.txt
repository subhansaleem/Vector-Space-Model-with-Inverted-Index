equipment condition diagnosis fault fingerprint extraction semiconductor manufacturing machine learning clustering equipment condition diagnosis ecd fault detection classification fdc k mean fault fingerprint extraction semiconductor manufacturing high tech production system get more complex equipment condition diagnosis ecd semiconductor manufacturing fault detection classification fdc becoming more more challenging than ever this paper us well known machine learning technique such support vector machine svm k mean clustering self organizing map som develop an efficient ecd model process normality checked by svm following by decomposing process dynamic via k mean abnormal observation then projected into normal model built by principal component analysis pca finally by calculating contribution value out control observation different fault fingerprint with corresponding fault root extracted again by k mean impact clustering technique investigated by comparing k mean som hierarchical clustering an empirical study wa conducted collaboration with leading semiconductor company france validate methodology result show that proposed approach effectively detect abnormal observation well automatically classify fault fingerprint give evident guideline explaining detected fault
