adding diversity rank example anytime nearest neighbor classification anytime algorithm nearest neighbor classification data stream data stream ubiquitous virtually every application domain however property that common various domain frequently disregarded very high fluctuating data rate which event not occur with fixed frequency classical learning algorithm not seem adequate such scenario contrast anytime classification provides very convenient approach this situation summary an anytime classifier interrupted any time before it completion still able provide an intermediate classification popular k nearest neighbor classifier easily made anytime by introducing ranking training example this paper show how current state art k nn anytime classifier made more accurate by introducing diversity training set ranking our result show that with this simple modification performance anytime version k nn algorithm consistently improved large number datasets
