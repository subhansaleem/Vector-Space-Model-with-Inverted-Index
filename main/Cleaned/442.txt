mapreduce based classification fault detection big data application fault detection big data application mapreduce bayesian classification recently emerging software application large complex distributed data intensive i e big data application that make monitoring such application challenging task due lack standard technique modeling analysis execution data i e log produced by such application another challenge imposed by big data application that execution data produced by such application also high volume velocity variety require high veracity value this paper present our monitoring solution that performs real time fault detection big data application our solution two fold first prescribe standard model structuring execution log second prescribe bayesian classification based analysis solution that mapreduce compliant distributed parallel single pas incremental that make it possible our proposed solution deployed executed cloud computing platform process log produced by big data application carried out complexity scalability usability analysis our proposed solution that how efficiently effectively it perform fault detection big data application
