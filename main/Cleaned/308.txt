study effect different control period neural network based reference modified pid control dc dc converter neural network dc dc converter control period computational burden this paper study about computational burden reference modified pid with neural network prediction dc dc converter flexible control method required realize superior transient response since converter nonlinear behavior however computational burden becomes problem implement control computation device this paper neural network adopted improve transient response output voltage dc dc converter under consideration it computational burden neural network computation part longer computation period than pid main control part it possible since neural network give more than one prediction which required reference modification each main control period therefore reference modification adopted every main control period from result it confirmed that proposed method improve transient response effectively with reducing computational burden neural network control
