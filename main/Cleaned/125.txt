example specific density based matching kernel scene classification using support vector machine kernel support vector machine visualization histogram feature extraction semantics maximum likelihood estimation this paper propose example specific density based matching kernel esdmk classification scene image represented set local feature vector proposed kernel computed between pair example represented set local feature vector by matching estimate example specific density computed every local feature vector those two example this work number local feature vector an example among k nearest neighbor local feature vector considered an estimate example specific density minimum two example specific density one each example local feature vector considered matching score esdmk then computed sum matching score computed every local feature vector pair example also propose spatial esdmk sesdmk include spatial information present scene image while matching pair scene image each scene image divided spatially into fixed number region then sesdmk computed combination region specific esdmks that match corresponding region study performance support vector machine svm based classifier using proposed esdmks scene classification compare with that svm based classifier using state art kernel set local feature vector
