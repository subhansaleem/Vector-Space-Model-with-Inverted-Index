improved wind power forecasting using combination method wind power forecasting forecast combination lp norm estimator fuzzy soft set regression tree random forest integration wind power into existing transmission grid an important issue due discontinuous volatile behavior wind moreover power plant owner need reliable information about day ahead power production market operation therefore wind power forecasting approach been gaining importance renewable energy research area wind power monitoring forecast system turkey ritm currently monitor growing number wind power plant turkey us wind power measurement addition different numerical weather prediction generate short term power forecast forecasting model ritm give considerably good result individually however forecast combination approach frequently used order not rely single forecast model also utilize forecast diversification this paper an analysis wind power domain current wind power forecasting method ritm presented then three main forecast combination approach namely lp norm based combination f fuzzy soft set based combination tree based combination proposed provide better forecast these combination method been verified forecast data ritm term normalized mean absolute error nmae metric experimental result show that applied combination method give lower nmae rate most wind power plant compared individual forecast
