event based weight update learning infinite spike train spiking neural network snn spike event spike train supervised learning multilayer network supervised learning method spiking neural network either able learn spike train single neuron or able learn first spike multilayer feedforward connection setting first group learning method not use computational benefit hidden layer neuron whereas second group learning method not exploit information transfer potential spike train although there been few effort learn spike train multilayer feedforward setting spiking neural network computational cost these method increase when spike train considered long period present spike event based weight update strategy that able learn spike train pattern multilayer feedforward spiking neural network efficient scalable learning spike train pattern indefinite period time will compare this method with relevant spiking neural network learning algorithm based different benchmark datasets show efficacy this event based weight update learning
