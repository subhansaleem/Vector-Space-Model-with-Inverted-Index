class decomposition using k mean hierarchical clustering class decomposition classification clustering machine learning this paper present clustering based class decomposition approach improve performance classifier class decomposition work by dividing each class into cluster by relabeling instance contained by each cluster with new class several case study used class decomposition combined with linear classifier while there an essential improvement classification accuracy because class decomposition most effective clustering algorithm not obvious aim this work investigate effect two clustering algorithm k mean hierarchical class decomposition this work study class decomposition when combined with naive bayes classifier using four real world datasets experimental result show an improvement classification accuracy most datasets when class decomposition using both k mean hierarchical clustering performed result also show that class decomposition not suitable datasets
