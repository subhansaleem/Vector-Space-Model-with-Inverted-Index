using k nearest neighbor speaker ranking phoneme prediction speech recognition phoneme k nearest neighbor classification phoneme prediction template matching speech recognition system either based parametric approach or non parametric approach parametric based system such hmms been dominant technology speech recognition past decade despite lot advancement enhancement design these system key problem such long term temporal dependence etc not yet been solved recently due availability large amount data inexpensive computing resource processing power memory parametric based approach solve speech recognition classification task becoming popular feasible key advantage parametric based approach that information from training data retained dont approximate our data with specific statistical model resulting more speaker specific information this paper propose knn phoneme prediction scheme using speaker ranking vector speaker ranking vector generated by finding similarity given test speaker with training data using knn result were compared with nearest neighbor knn majority voting approach our proposed scheme give better prediction accuracy compare with nearest neighbor knn majority voting scheme this approach help speech recognizer customize fly given talker customize training data basis similarity measure
