semi supervised kernel based temporal clustering kernel k mean semi supervised clustering temporal segmentation this paper adapt two existing method perform semi supervised temporal clustering aligned cluster analysis aca temporal clustering algorithm constrained spectral clustering semi supervised clustering algorithm first method add side information form pairwise constraint it objective function second add temporal search it framework also extend both method by propagating constraint throughout whole similarity matrix order validate advantage proposed semi supervised method temporal clustering evaluate them comparison their original version well another semi supervised temporal cluster three temporal datasets result show that proposed method competitive provide good improvement over unsupervised approach
