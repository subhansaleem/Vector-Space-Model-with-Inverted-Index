exploring impact clone refactoring test code size object oriented software object oriented software clone refactoring source code attribute test code size metric linear regression machine learning algorithm this paper aim exploring impact clone refactoring test code size term number operation object oriented software investigated three research question 1 impact clone refactoring three important source code attribute coupling complexity size that related unit testability class 2 impact clone refactoring test code size 3 variation after clone refactoring source code attribute that most important impact test code size used linear regression three popular machine learning technique i e k nearest neighbor naïve bayes random forest develop predictive explanatory model used data collected from an open source java software system ant that been refactored using clone refactoring technique analysis indicate that there strong positive relationship between clone refactoring reduction test code size result show that 1 source code attribute refactored class been significantly improved 2 test code size refactored class been significantly reduced 3 variation test code size more influenced by variation complexity size refactored class compared coupling
