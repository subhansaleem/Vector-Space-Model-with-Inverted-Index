adaptive modular approach online fault diagnosis discrete event system adaptive approach fault diagnosis discrete event system diagnosabiliy this paper an adaptive modular approach proposed achieve fault diagnosis discrete event system desired normal behavior represented by set specification while fault each predefined fault type considered execution specific fault behavior violating specification inference fault type each fault achieved by diagnosis module called diagnoser this approach considers that only normal behavior known advance then it adapts diagnoser order integrate new specific fault behavior into it inference engine this adaptation allows increasing diagnosis capacity called diagnosability over time
