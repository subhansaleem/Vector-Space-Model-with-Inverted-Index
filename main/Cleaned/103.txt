causal discovery from spatio temporal data with application climate science spatio temporal data causal discovery graphical model structure learning climate science climate causal discovery algorithm been used identify potential cause effect relationship from observational data decade recently more application emerging example climate science that extend over large spatial domain require temporal model this paper first review how causal discovery problem set such spatiotemporal problem using constraint based structure learning then discus pitfall encountered some solution developed particular consider how handle temporal spatial boundary which often result causal sufficiency violation discus effect temporal resolution grid irregularity resulting model
