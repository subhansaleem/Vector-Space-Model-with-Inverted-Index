ddos attack modeling detection using smo computer crime clustering algorithm firewall computing flood classification algorithm feature extraction port computer over last decade distributed denial service ddos attack been employed cause huge financial prestige loss different kind e business attacker also target governmental website using ddos attack new weapon world cyber war importance issue inspired many researcher from academia industry provide solution this type challenging attack this study simulated ddos attack virtual lab then collected firewall log from security information event management siem platform company field security management solution extracted 14 research feature from firewall log applied smo algorithm train our data using 10 fold cross validation smo with polykernel wa able create prediction model without any false alarm also tested our model with two different datasets this research an ongoing multistep study future research will concentrate online ddos detection
