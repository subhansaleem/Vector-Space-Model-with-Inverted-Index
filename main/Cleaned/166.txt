using machine learning understand mitigate model form uncertainty turbulence model machine learning turbulence modeling rule extraction question how accurately model turbulent flow one most long standing open problem physic advance high performance computing enabled direct numerical simulation increasingly complex flow nevertheless most flow engineering relevance computational cost these direct simulation prohibitive necessitating empirical model closure turbulent transport these empirical model prone model form uncertainty when their underlying assumption violated understanding quantifying mitigating this model form uncertainty become critical challenge turbulence modeling community this paper will discus strategy using machine learning understand root cause model form error develop model correction mitigate this error rule extraction technique used derive simple rule when critical model assumption violated physical intuition gained from these simple rule then used construct linear correction term turbulence model which show improvement over naive linear fit
