bilevel parameter tuning strategy partially connected anns optimization neuron tuning topology training time series analysis network topology partially connected ann with evolvable topology pannet non fully connected recurrent neural network with proper number context node structure network along with connection weight determined through evolutionary process customized genetic algorithm this paper develop an evolutionary bilevel optimization procedure tuning hyper parameter pannet upper level an evolutionary algorithm optimizes hyper parameter while customized genetic algorithm training pannet lower level optimization since executing lower level optimization each candidate hyper parameter requires high computational cost fitness function approximation performed using regression model based random forest method proposed procedure provides more flexibility choosing hyper parameter generate smaller network with more accuracy prediction
