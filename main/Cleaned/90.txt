improved selection auxiliary objective using reinforcement learning non stationary environment non stationary objective selection multiobjectivization auxiliary objective ea rl reinforcement learning efficiency evolutionary algorithm increased by using auxiliary objective method which called ea rl considered this method reinforcement learning rl algorithm used select objective evolutionary algorithm ea during optimization earlier study reinforcement learning algorithm stationary environment were used ea rl method however if behavior auxiliary objective change during optimization process it better use reinforcement learning algorithm which specially developed non stationary environment our previous work proposed new reinforcement learning algorithm used ea rl method this work propose an improved version that algorithm new algorithm applied non stationary problem compared with method which were used other study it shown that proposed method achieves optimal value more often obtains higher value target objective than other algorithm
