effect clustering data privacy data privacy privacy preserving anonymization clustering data diversity data obtained by various organization provide opportunity generating solution future it essential that accurate data must sharable with research community scientist order improve quality life however accurate record personal data include sensitive information about individual hence sharing these record without applying any anonymization criterion pave way disclosure personal privacy an effort protect personal privacy privacy preserving data mining ppdm privacy preserving data publishing ppdp approach been studied extensively numerous work been dedicated diversifying technique de identification or anonymization identifiable datasets but there an important trade off between data loss data privacy while original data anonymized it exposed information loss order minimize information loss anonymization algorithm discard keeping diversity this study proposed an approach that us clustering algorithm pre process privacy preserving method improve diversity anonymized data addition effect clustering anonymization wa evaluated by using original clustered form real world dataset result evaluated with aspect usability scientific work it wa observed that clustering algorithm an affective anonymization algorithm must used privacy preservation approach order keep diversity original datasets
