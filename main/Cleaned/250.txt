interaction network representation human behavior prediction human behavior prediction network representation learning deep learning health social network human behavior prediction critical studying how healthy behavior spread through social network this work present novel user representation based human behavior prediction model user representation based socialized gaussian process model ursgp first present deep interaction representation learning deep interaction model learning latent representation interaction social network which each user characterized by set attribute particular consider social interaction factor user attribute factor build bimodal fixed representation each user network our model aim capture evolution social interaction user attribute learn hidden correlation between them then use our latent feature human behavior prediction via ursgp model an empirical experiment conducted real health social network demonstrates that our model outperforms baseline approach human behavior prediction
