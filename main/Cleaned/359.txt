google s cloud vision api not robust noise google cloud vision api machine learning image noise adversarial machine learning google recently introduced cloud vision api image analysis according demonstration website api quickly classifies image into thousand category detects individual object face within image find read printed word contained within image it also used detect different type inappropriate content from adult violent content this paper evaluate robustness google cloud vision api input perturbation particular show that by adding sufficient noise image api generates completely different output noisy image while human observer would perceive it original content show that attack consistently successful by performing extensive experiment different image type including natural image image containing face image with text instance using image from imagenet dataset found that adding an average 14 25 impulse noise enough deceive api our finding indicate vulnerability api adversarial environment example an adversary bypass an image filtering system by adding noise inappropriate image then show that when noise filter applied input image api generates mostly same output restored image original image this observation suggests that cloud vision api readily benefit from noise filtering without need updating image analysis algorithm
