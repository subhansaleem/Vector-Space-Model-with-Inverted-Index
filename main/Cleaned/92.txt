iterative hard thresholding keyword extraction from large text corpus text analysis information retrieval iterative method statistical analysis better understand analyze text corpus such news it often useful extract keywords that meaningfully associated with given topic corpus document labeled by their topic used approach this learning problem consider this problem through lens statistical text analysis using bag word frequency feature sparse linear model demonstrate through numerical experiment that iterative hard thresholding iht practical effective algorithm keyword extraction from large text corpus fact our implementation iht quickly analyze more than 800 000 document returning keywords comparable algorithm solving lasso problem formulation with significantly le computation time further generalize analysis iht algorithm show that it stable rank deficient matrix those arising from our bag word model often
