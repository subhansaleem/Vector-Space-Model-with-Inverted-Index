using bipartite anomaly feature cyber security application spam authentication graph lateral movement cyber security bipartite graph anomaly detection this paper use anomaly score derived from technique bipartite graph feature supervised machine learning algorithm two cyber security problem classifying short message service sm text message either spam or non spam detecting malicious lateral movement within network while disparate problem both spam lateral movement detection viewed bipartite graph compute bipartite anomaly score each situation bipartite anomaly score by themselves not very predictive but used auxiliary feature boost receiver operating characteristic roc curve supervised classifier examine uci sm spam collection data set spam problem use an authentication graph from los alamo national laboratory create feature by dimensionality reduction through principal component analysis pca message term or user computer matrix then augment those feature with anomaly score by using anomaly score able improve area under curve auc receiver operating characteristic roc 27 5 spam data 21 4 authentication data
