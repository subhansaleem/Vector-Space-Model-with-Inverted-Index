automatic bitcoin address clustering bitcoin blockchain clustering privacy anonymity bitcoin digital asset infrastructure powering first worldwide decentralized cryptocurrency same name history bitcoins owning transferring address transaction available public ledger called blockchain but real world owner address not known general that s why bitcoin called pseudo anonymous however some address grouped by their ownership using behavior pattern publicly available information from off chain source blockchain based common behavior pattern analysis common spending one time change heuristic widely used bitcoin clustering vote address association while offchain information tag mostly used verify result this paper propose use off chain information vote address separation consider it together with blockchain information during clustering model construction step both blockchain off chain information not reliable our approach aim filter out error input data result study show feasibility proposed approached bitcoin address clustering it useful user avoid insecure bitcoin usage pattern investigator conduct more advanced de anonymizing analysis
