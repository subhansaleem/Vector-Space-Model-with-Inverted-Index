an empirical study cross lingual transfer learning technique small footprint keyword spotting transfer learning keyword spotting cross lingual small footprint this paper present our work building small footprint keyword spotting system resource limited language which requires low cpu memory latency our keyword spotting system consists deep neural network dnn hidden markov model hmm which hybrid dnn hmm decoder investigate different transfer learning technique leverage knowledge data from resource abundant source language improve keyword dnn training target language which limited domain data approach employed this paper include training dnn using source language data initialize target language dnn training mixing data from source target language together multi task dnn training setup using logits computed from dnn trained source language data regularize keyword dnn training target language well combination these technique given different amount target language training data our experimental result show that these transfer learning technique successfully improve keyword spotting performance target language measured by area under curve auc dnn hmm decoding detection error tradeoff det curve using large house far field test set
