nmf based label space factorization multi label classification multi label classification non negative matrix factorization feature aware multi label classification learning task which each data sample belong more than one class until now some method that based reducing dimensionality label space been proposed however these method not used specific property label space this purpose this paper intend find hidden space which both input feature vector label vector embedded propose modified non negative matrix factorization nmf method that suitable decomposing label matrix finding proper hidden space by feature aware approach consider that label matrix binary also this matrix some deserving label an instance may not called missing label conduct several experiment show superiority our proposed method state art multi label classification method
