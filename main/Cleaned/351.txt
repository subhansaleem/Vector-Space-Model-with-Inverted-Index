modeling over dispersion network data clustering over dispersion network data clustering cluster size distribution network community image segment over dispersed network data mining emerged central theme data science evident by sharp increase volume real world network data with imbalanced cluster while most existing clustering method designed discovering number cluster class specific connectivity pattern few method available uncover imbalanced cluster commonly existing network community image segment from network data with over dispersed cluster size distribution latter considered an intrinsic structural property network data this paper propose generalized probabilistic modeling framework sizeconnectivity estimate over dispersed cluster size distribution together with class specific connectivity pattern from network data wide range cluster size distribution revealed by real world network data accurately captured by our method performed extensive synthetic real world experiment clustering social network data image data detecting network community image segment our result demonstrate superior performance our sizeconnectivity clustering method recovering hidden structure network data via modeling over dispersion
