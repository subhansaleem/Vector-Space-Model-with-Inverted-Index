what learn next recommending command feature rich environment collaboration history recommender system software documentation computational modeling computer science despite an abundance command make task easier perform user feature rich application such development environment use only fraction command available earlier work shown that command recommendation which given command usage history set user objective predict command that likely useful user learn improve usage range command available within such application this paper present new algorithm codis which built upon three hypothesis first hypothesize that feature rich application there exists co occurrence pattern between command second hypothesize that user feature rich application prevalent discovery pattern finally hypothesize that user need different recommendation based time elapsed between their last activity time recommendation show data submitted by many user an integrated development environment eclipse that codis outperforms existing approach compared adagrad best performing baseline it achieves an improvement 10 22 recall top n recommendation task n 20
