human motion trajectory analysis based video summarization summarization human tracking trajectory analysis region interest curve simplification multimedia technology growing day by day contributing towards enormous amount video data especially area security surveillance browsing through such large collection video challenging time consuming task despite advancement technology automatic browsing retrieval manipulation analysis large video still far behind this paper fully automatic human centric system video summarization proposed most surveillance application human motion great interest proposed system moving part video detected using background subtraction blob extracted from binary image human detection done through histogram oriented gradient hog using support vector machine svm classifier then motion human tracked through consecutive frame using kalman filter trajectory each person extracted analysis trajectory lead meaningful summary which cover only important part video one also mark region interest included summary experimental result show proposed system reduces long video into meaningful summary save lot time cost term storage indexing browsing effort
