implementation machine learning classifying hemiplegic gait disparity through use force plate force plate hemiplegic gait logistic regression machine learning gait analysis synergy gait analysis tool with machine learning enables capacity classify disparity existing hemiplegic gait hemiplegic gait characterized by an affected unaffected leg which quantified by measurement force plate characteristic feature force plate recording gait consist two local maximum that represent braking push off phase stance their associated parameter quantified feature hemiplegic pair affected unaffected force plate recording intuitively disparate logistic regression achieves 100 classification between an affected unaffected hemiplegic leg pair based feature set force plate data
