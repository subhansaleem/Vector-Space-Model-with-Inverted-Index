privacy preserving solution bipartite ranking problem bipartite ranking problem privacy preserving data mining this paper propose an efficient solution privacy preserving bipartite ranking algorithm bipartite ranking problem considered finding function that rank positive instance dataset higher than negative one however one common concern existing scheme privacy individual dataset that one e g researcher need access record individual dataset order run algorithm this privacy concern put limitation use sensitive personal data such analysis rimarc ranking instance by maximizing area under roc curve algorithm solves bipartite ranking problem by learning model rank instance part model it learns weight each feature by analyzing area under receiver operating characteristic roc curve rimarc algorithm shown more accurate efficient than it counterpart thus use this algorithm building block provide privacy preserving version rimarc algorithm using homomorphic encryption secure multi party computation our proposed algorithm let data owner outsource storage processing it encrypted dataset semi trusted cloud then researcher get result query learn ranking function dataset by interacting with cloud during this process neither researcher nor cloud learns any information about raw dataset prove security proposed algorithm show it efficiency via experiment real data
