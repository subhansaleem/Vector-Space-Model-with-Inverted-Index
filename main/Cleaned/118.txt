evaluating uncertainty bayesian network query response by using joint probability distribution bayesian network machine learning effective sample size variance query response approximate inference bayesian network powerful tool represent pattern inside past data it used predict future by calculating posterior probability future event machine learning technique that construct bayesian network from past data automatically well developed recent year if consider past data sampling set from an original probabilistic distribution learning process actually trying reproduce original probabilistic distribution from sampling set therefore finiteness size sampling set will bring uncertainty reproduced parameter constructed bayesian network when constructed bayesian network used predict future uncertainty reproduced parameter will transferred uncertainty query response here query response posterior probability that interested evaluating uncertainty query response critical some strict industrial application previous research proposed method evaluate uncertainty consequence shown variance query response however conventional method need work together with bucket elimination an exact inference method therefore conventional method not deal with large bayesian network that used real application because it calculation cost proposed new approach calculate uncertainty query response by using joint probability distribution this research proposed method work with any inference method therefore it give an approximate evaluation even when bayesian network large by using an approximate inference method investigate accuracy our proposed method six well used public bayesian network used test case by comparing approximate result with exact result an average error 13 60 got
