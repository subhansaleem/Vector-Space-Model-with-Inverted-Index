direct multiclass boosting using base classifier posterior probability estimate machine learning boosting margin multiclass classification present new multiclass boosting algorithm called adaboost bg like original freund shapire s adaboost algorithm it aggregate tree but instead using their misclassification error it take into account margin observation which may seen confidence measure their prediction rather then their correctness prove efficiency our algorithm by simulation compare it similar approach known minimize global margin final classifier
