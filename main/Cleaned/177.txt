simplicity kmeans versus deepness deep learning case unsupervised feature learning with limited data kmeans clustering unsupervised feature learning deep learning bio detection study bio detection application case study demonstrate that kmeans based unsupervised feature learning simple yet effective alternative deep learning technique small data set with limited intra well inter class diversity investigate effect classifier performance data augmentation well feature extraction with multiple patch size different image scale our data set includes 1833 image from four different class bacteria each bacterial culture captured three different wavelength overall data collected during three day period limited number diversity image present potential random effect across multiple day multi mode nature class distribution pose challenging setting representation learning using image collected first day training second day validation third day testing kmeans based representation learning achieves 97 classification accuracy test data this compare very favorably 56 accuracy achieved by deep learning 74 accuracy achieved by handcrafted feature our result suggest that data augmentation or dropping connection between unit offer little help deep learning algorithm whereas significant boost achieved by kmeans based representation learning by augmenting data by concatenating feature obtained multiple patch size or image scale
