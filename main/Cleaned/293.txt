detecting smooth cluster change evolving graph spectral clustering evolving graph graph sequence clustering vertex graph or sequence graph important application network science bioinformatics other area most research date focused static graph or sequence where number vertex doe not change propose new algorithm that successfully partition vertex graph sequence into smooth cluster even when number vertex allowed vary over time our approach us spectral clustering relies applying k partition problem graph constructed from input graph sequence several experiment demonstrate performance our method it advantage over existing method
