complex decomposition negative distance kernel svm kernel function text categorization support vector machine svm become very popular machine learning method text classification one reason this relates range existing kernel which allow classifying data that not linearly separable linear polynomial rbf gaussian radial basis function kernel commonly used serve basis comparison our study show how derive primal form quadratic power kernel pk also called negative euclidean distance kernel ndk by mean complex number exemplify ndk framework text categorization using dewey document classification ddc target scheme our evaluation show that power kernel produce f score that comparable reference kernel but except linear kernel faster compute finally show how extend ndk approach by including mahalanobis distance
