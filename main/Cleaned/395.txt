limitation convolutional neural network recognizing negative image convolutional neural network negative image convolutional neural network cnns achieved state art performance variety computer vision task particularly visual classification problem where new algorithm reported achieve or even surpass human performance this paper examine whether cnns capable learning semantics training data this end evaluate cnns negative image since they share same structure semantics regular image human classify them correctly our experimental result indicate that when training regular image testing negative image model accuracy significantly lower than when it tested regular image this lead u conjecture that current training method not effectively train model generalize concept then introduce notion semantic adversarial example transformed input that semantically represent same object but model doe not classify them correctly present negative image one class such input
