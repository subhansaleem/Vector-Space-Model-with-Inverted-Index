decoding epileptogenesis reduced state space epilepsy epileptogenesis biomarker nonlinear dynamic hidden markov model describe here recent result multidisciplinary effort design biomarker that actively continuously decode progressive change neuronal organization leading epilepsy process known epileptogenesis using an animal model acquired epilepsy chronically record hippocampal evoked potential elicited by an auditory stimulus using set reduced coordinate our algorithm identify universal smooth low dimensional configuration auditory evoked potential that correspond distinct stage epileptogenesis use hidden markov model learn dynamic evoked potential it evolves along these smooth low dimensional subset provide experimental evidence that biomarker able exploit subtle change evoked potential reliably decode stage epileptogenesis predict whether an animal will eventually recover from injury or develop spontaneous seizure
