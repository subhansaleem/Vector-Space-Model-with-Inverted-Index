learning robust video synchronization without annotation deep learning synchronization video understanding large scale self supervised aligning video sequence fundamental yet still unsolved component broad range application computer graphic vision most classical image processing method not directly applied related video problem due high amount underlying data their limit small change appearance present scalable robust method computing non linear temporal video alignment approach autonomously manages it training data learning meaningful representation an iterative procedure each time increasing it own knowledge it leverage nature video themselves remove need manually created label while previous alignment method similarly consider weather condition season illumination our approach able align video from data recorded month apart
