deep learning microalgae classification microalgae classification imbalanced class deep learning convolutional neural network data augmentation microalgae unicellular organism that present limited physical characteristic such size shape or even present structure classifying them manually may require great effort from expert since thousand microalgae found small sample water furthermore manual classification non trivial operation proposed deep learning technique solve problem also created classified dataset that allow u adopt this technique best our knowledge present work first one apply this kind technique microalgae classification task obtained result show capability method properly classify data by using input low resolution image acquired by particle analyzer instead pre processed feature also show improvement provided by use data augmentation technique
