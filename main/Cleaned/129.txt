optimizing attack surface configuration diversity using multi objective reinforcement learning multi objective reinforcement learning cybersecurity moving target defense minimizing attack surface system introducing diversity into system two effective way improve system security however determining how include diversity system without increasing attack surface more than necessary difficult problem requiring knowledge about system characteristic operating environment available permutation that generally not available prior system deployment propose viewing system s component interface communication channel set state action that analyzed using sequential decision making process using multi objective reinforcement learning algorithm learn set policy that minimize system s attack surface execute those policy obtain configuration diversity while system operating describe methodology designing system such that it component behavior translated into multi objective markov decision process demonstrate use multi objective reinforcement learning learn set optimal policy using three different multi objective reinforcement learning algorithm context an online file sharing application show that our multi objective temporal difference afterstate algorithm outperforms alternative example problem
