railway incident ranking with machine learning incident ranking railway incident xgboost modern railway network include thousand failure registration device prompt response detected failure critical normal network operation however large share produced alert may formed by false alarm associated with maintenance or faulty diagnostics thus hindering processing actual failure it therefore very desirable perform fast automated intelligent ranking incident before they analyzed by human operator this paper describe machine learning based incident ranking model that developed deployed moscow railway network large network with 500 station model estimate probability failure using multiple feature incident hand model wa constructed using xgboost library database 5 million historical incident model show high accuracy auc 0 901 deployment environment
