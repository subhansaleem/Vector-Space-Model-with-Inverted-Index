neural network based handover management strategy heterogeneous network neural network based machine learning vertical handoff vho neural network classifier qos over heterogeneous network one key challenge improvement quality service qos heterogeneous wireless network design vertical handover vho management strategy vho required guide decision mobile terminal mt handoff between different type network this an essential task cope with various multimedia service qos setting this paper present machine learning scheme based neural network call vertical handover heterogeneous network neural network based handover management scheme nnbhms this paper aim toward achieving seamless connectivity always best connected abc call status group mobility over set heterogeneous network proposed scheme evaluates creates relationship between different decision criterion related heterogeneous network condition terminal capability application requirement user preference afterward estimate each attribute forwarded neural network select optimal access network proposed scheme applied vertical handover management heterogeneous network offering both real time service voice over ip service data service packet data traffic through implementation neural network based machine learning approach proposed research scheme allows solving complexity handover decision process resulting from multitude dimension decision criterion dynamicity many it component performance result evaluated through simulation show that use neural network based machine learning scheme carry out handover process enhance qos perceived by both type voice data service while fulfilling great extent user preference
