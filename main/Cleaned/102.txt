assessment different image clutter metric using multivariate analysis neurofuzzy system target detection computer vision statistical image clutter metric multivariate analysis neurofuzzy system image processing most frequently used technique computer vision like target detection monitored target image recognize background clutter observed target image evaluate performance various image processing algorithm image clutter metric very important useful factor better visual conception such increasing probability detection decreasing false alarm rate or relatively shorter searching time this paper different image clutter metric such probability detection false alarm rate search time assessed by statistical analysis technique neurofuzzy system through applying other statistical image clutter metric order improve machine visual conception with resolving machine cognitive constraint computer vision
