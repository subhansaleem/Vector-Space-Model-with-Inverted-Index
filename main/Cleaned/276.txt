distributed conformal anomaly detection conformal prediction anomaly detection distributed computing validity conformal approach anomaly detection wa recently developed reliable framework classifying example into normal abnormal group based training data set containing only normal example it validity property that normal example generated by same distribution example from training set classified anomaly with probability bounded from above by pre selected significance level parallel processing big data may require split training set into several source also assume that collection data two or more source might done parallel data distribution may differ these source contribution this work conformal anomaly detection studying way keeping conformal validity when training set obtained from heterogeneous differently distributed source
