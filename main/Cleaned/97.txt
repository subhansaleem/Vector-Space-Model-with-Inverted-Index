semi supervised clustering approach semantic slot labelling natural language processing semantic slot labelling semi supervised learning interactive system work training semantic slot labellers use natural language processing application typically either relied large amount labelled input data or assumed entirely unlabelled input former technique tends costly apply while latter often not accurate it supervised counterpart here present semi supervised learning approach that automatically label semantic slot set training data aim strike balance between dependence labelled data prediction accuracy essence our algorithm cluster clause based similarity function that combine lexical semantic information present experiment that compare different similarity function both our semi supervised setting fully unsupervised baseline while semi supervised learning expectedly outperforms unsupervised learning our result show that this effect observed based very few training data instance that increasing size training data doe not lead better performance that lexical semantic information contribute differently different domain so that clustering based both type information offer best generalisation
