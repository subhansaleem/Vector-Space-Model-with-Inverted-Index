example dependent cost sensitive logistic regression credit scoring cost sensitive classification credit scoring logistic regression several real world classification problem example dependent cost sensitive nature where cost due misclassification vary between example credit scoring typical example cost sensitive classification however it usually treated using method that not take into account real financial cost associated with lending business this paper propose new example dependent cost matrix credit scoring furthermore propose an algorithm that introduces example dependent cost into logistic regression using two publicly available datasets compare our proposed method against state art example dependent cost sensitive algorithm result highlight importance using real financial cost moreover by using proposed cost sensitive logistic regression significant improvement made sense higher saving
