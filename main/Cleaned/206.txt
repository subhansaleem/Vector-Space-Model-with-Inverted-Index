demonstration stability plasticity imbalance multi agent decomposition based learning stability plasticity dilemma layered learning decomposition based reinforcement learning layered learning machine learning paradigm used conjunction with direct policy search reinforcement learning method find high performance agent behavior complex task it core layered learning decomposition based paradigm that share many characteristic with robot shaping transfer learning hierarchical decomposition incremental learning previous study provided evidence that layered learning ability outperform standard monolithic method learning many case dilemma balancing stability plasticity common problem machine learning that cause learning agent compromise between retaining learned information perform task with new incoming information although existing work implies that there stability plasticity imbalance that greatly limit layered learning agent ability learn optimally work explicitly verifies existence imbalance or it cause this work investigates stability plasticity imbalance demonstrates that indeed layered learning heavily favor plasticity which cause learned subtask proficiency lost when new task learned conclude by identifying potential cause imbalance layered learning provide high level advice about how mitigate imbalance s negative effect
