intelligent bus stop identification using smartphone sensor intelligent system bus transportation machine learning gps sensor intelligent transportation system built by developing model that learn from collected transport data data collection implementation such system often costly few country support such system their transportation budget place where maintaining currency accuracy information difficult many problem arise instance chennai india real time bus transit data not maintained there proper communication about bus schedule bus stop not regularly updated inconsistent information about bus stop observed transport authority s website interested developing model identifying bus stop from trajectory situation where accurate current information not available traffic condition challenging such chennai india develop simple yet easily accessible android mobile application app collect gps trace bus route use our app collect gps trajectory data from baltimore maryland place where there facility access date information about bus stop also collect gps trajectory from chennai india then develop model using machine learning technique identify bus stop from collected trajectory experimentally evaluate our model by training it baltimore dataset testing it chennai dataset achieving testing accuracy between 85 90 this comparable accuracy 95 achieved by both training testing chennai dataset this illustrates that our approach effective helping maintain an accurate current transport information system resource constraint environment
