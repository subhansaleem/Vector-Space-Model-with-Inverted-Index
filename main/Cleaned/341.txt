multiview centroid based fuzzy classification large data classification soft clustering multiview data modern data increasingly complex high dimensionality heterogeneity independent multiple representation basic property today s data with increasing source data collection single object multiple representation which call view this paper propose multiview classification technique which us fuzzy mapping obtain maximum similarity between an object nearest multiview centroid our fuzzy mapping based approach obtains unit l1 hyperplane common space each view establish efficacy our proposed method present experimental comparison with number baseline two synthetic two real world data set
