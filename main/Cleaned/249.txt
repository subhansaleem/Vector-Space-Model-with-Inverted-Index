hierarchical meta classifier human activity recognition accelerometer legged locomotion feature extraction monitoring data mining activity recognition decision tree this paper proposes multi level meta classifier identifying human activity based accelerometer data training data consists 77 subject performing combination 23 different activity monitored using single hip worn triaxial accelerometer time frequency based feature were extracted from two second window raw accelerometer data subset feature together with demographic information wa selected classification activity were divided into five activity group non ambulatory activity walking running climbing upstairs climbing downstairs multiple classification technique were tested each classifier level group random forest were found perform comparatively better each level based upon those test 3 level hierarchical classifier consisting 5 random forest classifier wa built first level non ambulatory activity separated from rest second ambulatory activity divided into four activity group final level activity classified individually accuracy test set wa found approximately 87 overall individual activity 94 activity group level these result compare favorably contemporary result classifying human activity
