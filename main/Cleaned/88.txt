transient characteristic dc dc converter with pid parameter selection neural network control neural network dc dc converter pid control this paper present neural network based pid parameter selection control improve transient response dc dc converter conventional pid control parameter it such proportional integral differential coefficient selected fixed parameter regulate both transient steady state characteristic simultaneously much possible parameter setting pid control not optimal improvement transient state characteristic since setting need satisfy stable steady state characteristic therefore parameter selection different state widely applicable from point view improvement transient response this study present novel parameter selection method pid control based load change prediction neural network improve transient response dc dc converter presented method suitable pid parameter selected with neural network this neural network trained predict load change from output voltage dc dc converter advance from predicted result neural network pid parameter changed optimal one after load change occurs additionally reference modification with another neural network which trained modify reference value pid control also adopted simultaneously obtain more effective improvement transient response from evaluation result confirm that our presented method contributes obtain an effective improvement transient response compared conventional pid control
