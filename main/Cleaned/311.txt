early identification vulnerable software component via ensemble learning vulnerability ensemble learning support vector machine mislabeled data software component which vulnerable being exploited need identified patched employing any prevention technique designed purpose detecting vulnerable software component early stage reduce expense associated with software testing process significantly thus help building more reliable robust software system although previous study demonstrated effectiveness adapting prediction technique vulnerability detection feasibility those technique limited mainly because insufficient training data set this paper proposes prediction technique targeting early identification potentially vulnerable software component proposed scheme potentially vulnerable component viewed mislabeled data that may contain true but not yet observed vulnerability proposed hybrid technique combine support vector machine algorithm ensemble learning strategy better identify potential vulnerable component proposed vulnerability detection scheme evaluated using some java android application result demonstrated that proposed hybrid technique could identify potentially vulnerable class with high precision relatively acceptable accuracy recall
