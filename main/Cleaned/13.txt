learning good feature track object tracking convolutional neural network feature learning object tracking an important task within field computer vision tracking accuracy depends mainly finding good discriminative feature estimate target location this paper introduce online feature learning tracking propose learn good feature track generic object using online convolutional neural network ocnn ocnn two feature mapping layer that trained offline based unlabeled data tracking it also augmented with classifier provide decision order learn discriminative stable feature tracking propose novel object function train ocnn by penalizing feature variation consecutive frame build tracking system by combining ocnn color based multi appearance model our experimental result publicly available video datasets show that tracking system superior performance when compared with several state art tracker
