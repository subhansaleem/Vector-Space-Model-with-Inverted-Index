frequent set mining streaming mixed large data frequent set mining discretization large data mixed data streaming frequent set mining well researched problem due it application many area data mining such clustering classification association rule mining most existing work focus categorical batch data not scale well large datasets this work focus frequent set mining mixed data introduce discretization methodology find meaningful bin boundary when itemsets contain least one continuous attribute an update strategy keep frequent item relevant event concept drift parallel algorithm find these frequent item our approach identifies local bin per itemset global discretization may not identify most meaningful bin since relationship between attribute my change over time rule updated using weighted average method our algorithm fit well hadoop framework so it scaled large datasets
