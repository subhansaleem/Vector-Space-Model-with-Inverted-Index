comparing transfer learning traditional learning under domain class imbalance transfer learning domain class imbalance traditional machine learning transfer learning subclass machine learning which us training data source drawn from different domain than that testing data target transfer learning environment characterized by unavailability labeled data from target domain due data being rare or too expensive obtain however there exists abundant labeled data from different but similar domain these two domain likely different distribution characteristic transfer learning algorithm attempt align distribution characteristic source target domain create high performance classifier this paper provides comparative performance analysis between stateof art transfer learning algorithm traditional machine learning algorithm under domain class imbalance condition domain class imbalance condition characterized by source target domain having different class probability which create marginal distribution difference between source target data statistical analysis provided show significance result
