measuring modelling delay robot manipulator temporally precise control using machine learning robot control automation machine learning algorithm latency delay play an important role temporally precise robot control during dynamic task particular robot account inherent delay reach manipulated object time different type occurring delay typically convoluted thereby hard measure separate this paper present data driven methodology separating modelling inherent delay during robot control show how both actuation response delay modelled using modern machine learning method resulting model used predict delay well uncertainty prediction experiment two widely used robot platform show significant actuation response delay standard control loop predictive model therefore used reason about expected delay improve temporal accuracy during control approach easily used different robot platform
