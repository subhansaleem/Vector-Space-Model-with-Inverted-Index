new algorithm adaptive online selection auxiliary objective parameter control reinforcement learning multi objectivization evolutionary algorithm consider optimization problem where target objective should optimized some auxiliary objective used obtain optimum target objective le number objective evaluation call such auxiliary objective supporting one usually there prior knowledge about property auxiliary objective some objective obstructive well what more an auxiliary objective both supporting obstructive different stage target objective optimization thus an adaptive online method objective selection needed earlier proposed method doing that which based reinforcement learning this paper new algorithm adaptive online selection optimization objective proposed algorithm meet interface reinforcement learning agent so it fit into previously proposed framework new algorithm applied solving some benchmark problem with single objective evolutionary algorithm specifically leading one with onemax auxiliary objective considered well mh iff problem experimental result presented proposed algorithm outperforms q learning random objective selection considered problem
