probabilistic programming approach outlier detection healthcare claim fraud detection outlier detection healthcare fraud bayesian inference probabilistic programming healthcare an integral component people s life especially rising elderly population medicare one such healthcare program that provides need elderly it imperative that these healthcare program affordable but this not always case out many possible factor rising cost healthcare claim fraud major contributor but it impact lessened through effective fraud detection propose general outlier detection model based bayesian inference using probabilistic programming our model provides probability distribution rather than just point value with most common outlier detection method credible interval also generated further enhance confidence that detected outlier should fact considered outlier two case study presented demonstrating our model s effectiveness detecting outlier first case study us temperature data order provide clear comparison several outlier detection technique second case study us medicare dataset showcase our proposed outlier detection model our result show that successful detection outlier which indicate possible fraudulent activity provide effective meaningful result further investigation within medical specialty or by using real world medical provider fraud investigation case
