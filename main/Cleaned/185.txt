diagnosis bearing defect induction motor by fuzzy neighborhood density based clustering fault diagnosis bearing defect induction motor fuzzy neighborhood density based clustering this paper supervised fuzzy neighborhood density based clustering approach proposed fault diagnosis induction motor bearing proposed approach make use labeled data regarding actual class faulty fault free case order train fuzzy neighborhood density based clustering algorithm supervised manner by resorting an invasive weed optimization algorithm that aim minimize an error based objective function proposed classifier properly classify multi class data with complex variously shaped decision boundary among different class fault fault free state robust against noise this due mainly fact that classifier constructed using fuzzy neighborhood density based clustering method which not sensitive geometrical shape cluster feature space
