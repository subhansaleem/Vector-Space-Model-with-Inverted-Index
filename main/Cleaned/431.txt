audio signal reconstruction using cartesian genetic programming evolved artificial neural network cgpann audio signal reconstruction neural network signal processing propose novel audio signal reconstruction model that make use non linear estimation algorithm called cartesian genetic programming evolved artificial neural network cgpann cgpann estimate non linear graph audio signal with much better accuracy than it counterpart interpolation extrapolation compared them term snr improvement ability deal with disputed data unlike other conventional reconstruction algorithm proposed algorithm restore signal which damaged 50 by noise state art approach reconstructing an audio signal utilizing machine learning presented this paper performance algorithm evaluated by measuring it signal noise snr improvement difference between original reconstructed signal term mean absolute percentage error mape snr improvement 20 db recorded single point estimation with 25 missing sample 19 db multi point 5 estimation which half data missing 16 db signal with random variable noise
