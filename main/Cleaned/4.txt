reducing effect detrimental instance filtering label noise instance weighting not instance data set equally beneficial inducing model data some instance such outlier or noise detrimental however least initially instance data set generally considered equally machine learning algorithm many current approach handling noisy detrimental instance make binary decision about whether an instance detrimental or not this paper 1 extend this paradigm by weighting instance continuous scale 2 present methodology measuring how detrimental an instance may inducing model data call our method identifying weighting detrimental instance reduced detrimental instance learning rdil examine ridl set 54 data set 5 learning algorithm compare ridl with other weighting filtering approach rdil especially useful learning algorithm where every instance affect classification boundary training instance considered individually such multilayer perceptrons trained with backpropagation mlps our result also suggest that more accurate estimate which instance detrimental significant positive impact handling them
