an edge le approach horizon line detection horizon line detection skyline extraction support vector machine convolutional neural network dynamic programming horizon line promising visual cue which exploited robot localization or visual geo localization prominent approach horizon line detection rely edge detection pre processing step which inherently non stable approach due parameter choice underlying assumption present novel horizon line detection approach which us machine learning dynamic programming dp extract horizon line from classification map instead an edge map key idea assigning classification score each pixel which interpreted likelihood pixel belonging horizon line representing classification map multi stage graph using dp horizon line extracted by finding path that maximizes sum classification score contrast edge map which typically binary edge v edge contain gap classification map continuous contain gap yielding significantly better solution using classification map instead edge map allows removing certain assumption such horizon close top image or that horizon form straight line purpose these assumption bias dp solution but they fail produce good result when they not valid demonstrate our approach three different data set provide comparison with traditional approach based edge map although our training set comprised very small number image from same location our result illustrate that our method generalizes well image acquired under different condition geographical location
