predictive modelling strategy understand heterogeneous manifestation asthma early life wheeze pre school feature selection predictive modelling roc analysis model post processing monte carlo wheezing common among child 50 those under 6 year age thought experience least one episode wheeze however due heterogeneity symptom there difficulty treating diagnosing these child phenotype specific therapy one possible avenue treatment whereby use significant pathology physiology identify treat pre schoolers with wheeze by performing feature selection algorithm predictive modelling technique this study will attempt determine if it possible robustly distinguish patient diagnostic category among pre school child univariate feature analysis identified more objective variable recursive feature elimination larger number subjective variable important distinguishing between patient category predicative modelling saw drop performance when subjective variable were removed from analysis indicating that these variable important distinguishing wheeze class achieved 90 performance auc sensitivity specificity accuracy 80 kappa statistic distinguishing ill from healthy patient developed synergistic statistical machine learning approach our methodology propose also novel roc cross evaluation method model post processing evaluation our predictive modelling s stability wa assessed computationally intensive monte carlo simulation
