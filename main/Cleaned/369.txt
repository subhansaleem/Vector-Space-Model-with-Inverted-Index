automatic algorithm recognition source code using machine learning algorithm recognition machine learning feature recognition codebases software project get larger reaching range million line code need computer aided program comprehension grows define one task program comprehension algorithm recognition given piece source code from file identify algorithm this code implementing such brute force or dynamic programming most research this area making use pattern matching which involves much human effort questionable accuracy when structure semantics program change thus this paper proposes let go defined pattern make use simpler feature such count variable count different construct recognize algorithm then feed these feature classification algorithm predict class or type algorithm used this source code show through experimental result that our proposed method achieves good improvement over baseline
