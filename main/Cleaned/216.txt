identifying daily electric consumption pattern from smart meter data by mean clustering algorithm fault diagnosis valve mathematical model sensor radio frequency discrete event system adaptation model this paper present clustering approach applied daily energy consumption curve building our aim identify reduced set consumption pattern tertiary building during one year these pattern depend temperature throughout year well type day working day work free day school holiday two clustering approach used independently namely functional k mean algorithm that take into account functional aspect data expectation maximization algorithm based gaussian mixture model em gmm clustering result two algorithm analyzed compared this study represents first step towards development prediction model energy consumption
