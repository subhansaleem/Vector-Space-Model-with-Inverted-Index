iteratively learning liver segmentation using probabilistic atlas preliminary result liver segmentation probabilistic atlas viscous reconstruction this work deal with concept liver segmentation by using priori information based probabilistic atlas segmentation learning based previous step probabilistic atlas here understood probability or membership map that tell how likely that point belongs shape drawn from shape distribution hand devise procedure segment perfusion magnetic resonance liver image that combine both probabilistic atlas liver segmentation algorithm based global information previous simpler segmentation step local information from close segmented slice finally mathematical morphology procedure namely viscous reconstruction fill shape preliminary result algorithm provided
