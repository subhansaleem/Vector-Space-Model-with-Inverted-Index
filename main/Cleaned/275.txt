an led based indoor localization system using k mean clustering indoor localization k mean unsupervised learning clustering this paper introduces novel visible light positioning vlp system using an un supervised machine learning approach two transmitter consist light emitting diode led which modulated with 1 khz 2 5 khz sinusoidal signal respectively receiver end received signal strength r calculated sparse grid cube constructed by measuring light intensity different location bilinear interpolation then applied create dense grid reading which used training hierarchical k mean clustering system given query led reading trained cluster used position estimation by minimizing distance between reading cluster centroid experimental result show that an average accuracy 0 31m achieved room with dimension 4 3 4 4 m3 further compared performance two other clustering method k medoids fuzzy c mean however significant improvement over kmeans clustering found
