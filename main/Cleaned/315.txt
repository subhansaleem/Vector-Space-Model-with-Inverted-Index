web based pipeline tool combination logic condition ng data next generation sequence ng pipeline genome analysis toolkit gatk development software tool analyze next generation sequencing ng data one urgent task bioinformatics field currently lot next generation sequencing data analysis software been developed however most them only support one type analysis such sequence alignment or function annotation by command line therefore friendly user interface ng data with fewer configuration necessary this paper web based automatic pipeline running high performance computing environment wa introduced raw data wa generated from illumine sequencing instrument gatk based parallel commutating scheme used control generate result pipeline start from fastq file uploaded by graphical interface then data will analyzed automatically
