finite gamma mixture model based discriminative learning framework mixture model gamma distribution generative learning svm object recognition 3d shape video event it well known that classification task approached using either generative model or discriminative one while goal generative approach learn class conditional density main goal discriminative technique learn decision boundary directly without taking into account class conditional density classic supervised learning would usually represent given object an image instance by vector d real valued feature then select given generative or discriminative approach perform classification many application however object represented by set or bag vector recent development machine learning along with powerful computational tool enabled researcher develop more sophisticated model handle such application using so called hybrid generative discriminative model main idea based exploiting advantage both family model thus success such an approach depends choice an appropriate discriminative technique suitable generative one goal this paper develop hybrid generative discriminative framework based support vector machine gamma mixture particular focus generation kernel when example image instance structured data i e described by set vector modeled by gamma mixture experimental result real world challenging application namely 3d shape class recognition object categorization video event analysis show effectiveness proposed framework
