code centric cluster based approach searching online support forum programmer forum programmer unsupervised machine learning online forum provide peer peer technical support many user population including programmer struggling master new language programmer help one another by uploading code sample such forum unfortunately finding relevant code sample prove difficult using existing search engine large diverse forum therefore prototyped new kind code search engine online forum that draw upon unsupervised machine learning two way first it display code sample visual grouping based mutual similarity code sample second it us assignment code sample cluster achieve form query expansion thereby identifying additional search result potentially useful evaluated system by running it forum labview programming language textual analysis post showed that unsupervised machine learning algorithm successfully tended assign code sample cluster based topical similarity an empirical user evaluation confirmed that new search engine improved forum s existing search engine by providing result more query by generating more result per query by providing more relevant search result
