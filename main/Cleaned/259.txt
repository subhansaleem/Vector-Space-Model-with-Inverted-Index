bag bag nested multi instance classification prostate cancer detection multi instance classification cancer detection computer aided detection cad computer aided detection cad algorithm been proposed auto detection different type cancer cad algorithm rely machine learning method classify region interest image into cancerous healthy region cancer screening foremost problem solve whether patient cancer regardless location cancerous region organ this allows early detection disease leading right course action term treatment taken machine learning this problem been formulated multi instance learning mil where bag instance classified rather than individual instance this paper propose bag bag bob nested mil algorithm where high level bag or parent bag each contains multiple smaller bag instance applied proposed bob mil algorithm prostate cancer detection problem using magnetic resonance imaging data first detect which patient cancer consequently detect which slice 3d volume imaging data detected patient contain cancerous region experimental result obtained from imaging data 30 patient with ground truth data based biopsy result show that proposed algorithm not only capable detecting prostate cancer patient level it also able detect cancerous region slice level imaging data with high accuracy
