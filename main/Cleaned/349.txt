anomaly prediction based k mean clustering memory constrained embedded device anomaly prediction k mean clustering online k mean clustering this paper proposes an anomaly prediction method based k mean clustering that assumes embedded device with memory constraint predict control system anomaly with this method by checking control system behavior it possible predict anomaly however continuing clustering difficult because data accumulate memory similar existing k mean clustering method which problematic embedded device with low memory capacity therefore also propose k mean clustering continue clustering infinite stream data proposed k mean clustering method based online k mean clustering sequential processing proposed k mean clustering method only store data required anomaly prediction release other data from memory experimental result show that anomaly predicted by k mean clustering proposed method predict anomaly similar standard k mean clustering while reducing memory consumption moreover proposed k mean clustering demonstrates better result anomaly prediction than existing online k mean clustering
