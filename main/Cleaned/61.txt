protein conformation motion modeling using sep cma e mass transfer cma e protein conformation conformation motion problem protein conformation motion modeling an open problem structural computational biology it difficult solve it using method molecular dynamic or quantum physic because these method deal with time interval nanosecond or microsecond while conformation motion take time millisecond order addition these method not take external force into consideration cope with these problem numerous approximated coarse grained method developed which use idea from geometry motion planning present new coarse grained method modeling protein motion between two given conformation method based optimization cost function similar one monge kantorovich mass transfer problem optimization performed using sep cma e which make running time an iteration linear number amino acid protein proposed method compared with some existing method several molecule it shown that result proposed method more accurate than other method
