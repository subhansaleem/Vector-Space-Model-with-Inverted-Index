understading image restoration convolutional neural network with network inversion deep learning neural network underwater dehazing visualization image restoration recent year convolutional neural network cnns achieved state art performance many image restoration application knowledge how these model work however still limited while there been many attempt better understanding inner working cnns they mostly been applied classification network because this most existing cnn visualization technique may inadequate study image restoration architecture paper present network inversion new method developed specifically help understanding image restoration convolutional neural network apply our method underwater image restoration dehazing cnns showing how it help understanding improvement these model
