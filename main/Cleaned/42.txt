sequential logistic principal component analysis slpca dimensional reduction streaming multivariate binary state system energy end use model dimensional reduction sequential optimization sequential or online dimensional reduction interest due explosion streaming data based application requirement adaptive statistical modeling many emerging field such modeling energy end use profile principal component analysis pca classical way dimensional reduction however traditional singular value decomposition svd based pca fails model data which largely deviate from gaussian distribution bregman divergence wa recently introduced achieve generalized pca framework if random variable under dimensional reduction follow bernoulli distribution which occurs many emerging field generalized pca called logistic pca lpca this paper extend batch lpca sequential version i e slpca based sequential convex optimization theory convergence property this algorithm discussed compared batch version lpca i e blpca well it performance reducing dimension multivariate binary state system it application building energy end use profile modeling also investigated
