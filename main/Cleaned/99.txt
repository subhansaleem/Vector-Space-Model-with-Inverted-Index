machine sourced segmentation v expert sourced segmentation classification lung nodule with outlier removal machine sourced computer aided diagnosis crowd sourcing lung cancer segmentation computer aided diagnosis system provide additional opinion that serve an aid radiologist early detection lung nodule previous cad model relied radiologist delineated contour extract image feature classify lung nodule into semantic rating manually creating these contour time consuming expensive this paper proposes different cad system based multiple machine sourced segmentation that provide semantic rating least accurate panel expert order aid diagnostic process however mass production machine sourced segmentation may sometimes produce unwanted noise therefore propose filter out bad segmentation by applying an outlier detection algorithm that identifies segmentation that far away from majority segmentation our result compared cad system based expert sourced contour reference truth generated by radiologist semantic rating using lung image database consortium dataset show that machine sourced segmentation provide prediction least good expert sourced segmentation how outlier removal affect mostly shape dependent semantic rating
