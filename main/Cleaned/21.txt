human action recognition based recognition linear pattern action bank feature using convolutional neural network human action recognition action bank feature deep convolutional network this paper proposed deep convolutional network architecture recognizing human action video using action bank feature action bank feature computed against predefined set video known an action bank contain linear pattern representing similarity video against action bank video due independence pattern across action bank feature convolutional neural network with linear mask considered capture local pattern associated with each action knowledge gained through training used assign an action label video during testing experiment conducted ucf50 dataset demonstrates effectiveness proposed approach capturing recognizing these linear local pattern
