hdltex hierarchical deep learning text classification text mining document classification deep neural network hierarchical learning deep learning increasingly large document collection require improved information processing method searching retrieving organizing text central these information processing method document classification which become an important application supervised learning recently performance traditional supervised classifier degraded number document increased this because along with growth number document come an increase number category this paper approach this problem differently from current document classification method that view problem multi class classification instead perform hierarchical classification using an approach call hierarchical deep learning text classification hdltex hdltex employ stack deep learning architecture provide specialized understanding each level document hierarchy
