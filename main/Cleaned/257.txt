re estimation brain storm optimization train hidden markov model transcription factor binding site analysis hidden markov model training optimization convergence silicon algorithm design analysis robustness computational analysis transcription factor binding site tfbs one most challenging topic bioinformatics set tfbs sequence type multiple sequence alignment msa thus hidden markov model hmm powerful tool model msa been extensively applied tfbs analysis however with size tfbs problem training hmm deterministic way computationally intractable while traditional heuristic baum welch bw algorithm depends heavily initial condition evolutionary optimizatioin approach been applied train model these method showed reasonable result but much improve this paper proposed re estimation brain storm optimization rbso algorithm train hmm tfbs analysis our hybrid algorithm combine global optimizing ability brain storm optimization bso advantage convergence speed bw based re estimation operator algorithm considerable improvement compared traditional bso comparative experiment rbso performed significantly better than other approach that been used this problem judging from critical criterion including log odds score convergence speed robustness result indicate that our algorithm very promising extensive use future tfbs sequencing study
