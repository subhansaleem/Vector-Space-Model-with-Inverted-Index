an application classification class decomposition use case point estimation method effort prediction classification clustering use case point ucp estimation method describes process computing software project size productivity from use case diagram element these metric then used predict project effort early stage software development main challenge with previous model that they were constructed based very limited number observation using limited productivity ratio this paper present new approach predict productivity from ucp environmental factor by applying classification with decomposition technique class decomposition provides number advantage supervised learning algorithm through segmenting class into more homogenous class therefore increase their diversity proposed model constructed validated over two datasets that relatively sufficient number observation accuracy result promising potential increase accuracy early effort estimation
