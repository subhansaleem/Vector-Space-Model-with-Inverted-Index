classification occluded object using fast recurrent processing recurrent processing occlusion neural network recurrent neural network powerful tool handling incomplete data problem computer vision thanks their significant generative capability however computational demand these algorithm too high work real time without specialized hardware or software solution this paper propose framework augmenting recurrent processing capability into feedforward network without sacrificing much from computational efficiency assume mixture model generate sample last hidden layer according class decision output layer modify hidden layer activity using sample propagate lower layer visual occlusion problem iterative procedure emulates feedforward feedback loop filling missing hidden layer activity with meaningful representation proposed algorithm tested widely used dataset shown achieve 2 improvement classification accuracy occluded object when compared restricted boltzmann machine our algorithm show superior performance occluded object classification
