graphical model based approach fault diagnosis wind turbine lasso estimate wind turbine pitch system wind turbine operation maintenance cost depend reliability it component thus critical task detect isolate fault fast possible restore optimal operating condition shortest time this paper machine learning graphical model approach proposed fault diagnosis wind turbine particular pitch system role latter adjust blade pitch angle by rotating it according current wind speed order optimize wind turbine power production this achieved by controller based blade pitch angle measured by two redundant sensor each blade without sensor accuracy reading controller misled fail achieve optimal control strategy according current operation condition addition pitch angle sensor complete failure lead dangerous action controller while fixed or drifted bias sensor measurement may decrease controller s efficiency better control overcome these challenge propose methodology that based gaussian acyclic graphical model lasso estimate methodology shown ability model diagnose fault that occur pitch system wind turbine during it normal run could lead fast recovery optimal operating condition
