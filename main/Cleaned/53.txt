improving robustness gaussian process based inferential control system using kernel principle component analysis control system process control kernel gaussian process principal component analysis robustness vector plausibility robustness an inferential control system entirely depend prediction accuracy estimator used feedback element this paper based previously proposed gaussian process inferential controller that employ gaussian process soft sensor an estimator paper enhances robustness reliability control system particularly during sensor input failure contribution paper i alleviating affect failure prediction accuracy feedback element soft sensor thus improving robustness overall control system ii hybridising kernel principal component analysis with gaussian process inferential control system achieve this robustness during process operating condition paper empirically show effectiveness plausibility processed hybrid system simulated chemical reactor process
