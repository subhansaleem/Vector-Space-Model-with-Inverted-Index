hybrid machine learning approach planning safe trajectory complex traffic scenario hybrid learning algorithm trajectory planning road traffic 3d convnets planning safe trajectory with intervention both lateral longitudinal dynamic vehicle huge potential increasing road traffic safety main challenge development such algorithm consideration vehicle nonholonomic constraint efficiency term implementation so that algorithm run real time vehicle recently introduced augmented cl rrt algorithm an approach that us analytical model trajectory planning based brute force evaluation many longitudinal acceleration profile find collision free trajectory algorithm considers nonholonomic constraint vehicle complex road traffic scenario with multiple static dynamic object but it requires lot computation time this work proposes hybrid machine learning approach predicting suitable acceleration profile critical traffic scenario so that only few acceleration profile used with augmented cl rrt find safe trajectory while reducing computation time this realized using convolutional neural network variant introduced 3d convnet which learns spatiotemporal feature from sequence predicted occupancy grid generated from prediction other road traffic participant these learned feature together with hand designed feature ego vehicle used predict acceleration profile simulation performed compare brute force approach with proposed approach term efficiency safety result show vast improvement term efficiency without harming safety additionally an extension augmented cl rrt algorithm introduced finding trajectory with low severity injury if collision already unavoidable
