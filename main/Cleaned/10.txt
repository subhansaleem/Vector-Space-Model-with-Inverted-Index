detection abnormal human behavior using matrix approximation based approach abnormal event detection low rank approximation adaptive learning automatic detection abnormal event one central task video surveillance this paper present matrix approximation based method detect abnormal human behavior our model behavior pattern represented by motion matrix obtained through object tracking model typical motion associated with normal behavior with set motion subspace computed through low rank matrix approximation then abnormal human behavior identified by motion deviation from representative subspace our method doe not require complicated classification procedure fast detect abnormal event complex scene addition through adaptive learning module our model built observed data expanded by incorporating new behavior pattern during detection process result simulated surveillance video show effectiveness our method
