lacova tree based multi label classifier using label covariance splitting criterion multi label learning decision tree covariance matrix splitting criterion dealing with multiple label supervised learning problem increasing importance multi label classifier face challenge exploiting correlation between label while existing work these correlation often modelled globally this paper use divide conquer approach decision tree which enables taking local decision about how best model label dependency resulting algorithm establishes tree based multi label classifier called lacova which dynamically interpolates between two well known baseline method binary relevance which assumes label independent label powerset which learns joint label distribution key idea splitting criterion based label covariance matrix that node which allows u choose between horizontal split branching feature vertical split separating label empirical result 12 data set show strong performance proposed method particularly data set with hundred label
