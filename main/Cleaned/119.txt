nonparametric bayesian modeling automated database schema matching computational modeling bayes method government data integration database metadata problem merging database arises many government commercial application schema matching common first step identifies equivalent field between database introduce schema matching framework that build nonparametric bayesian model each field compare them by computing probability that single model could generated both field our experiment show that our method more accurate faster than existing instance based matching algorithm part because use nonparametric bayesian model
