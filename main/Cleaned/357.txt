impact noise from group based label collection visual classification visual classification noisy training data group based labeling state art visual classification continues improve particularly with use deep learning million labeled image however effort required label training set this size led semi supervised approach that collect partially noisy labeled data with le effort label noise been shown degrade supervised learning but these analysis focus noise from erroneous label assignment data instance group based labeling reduces workload by assigning single label group image simultaneously which introduces label noise with structure dependent training instance this work investigates impact group based label noise classifier learning discus how why this differs from instance based label noise also discus label noise modeling designed provide more robust classification given noisy training instance evaluate generalization these technique group based noise
