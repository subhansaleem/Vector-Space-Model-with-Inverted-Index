automated detection adenoviral conjunctivitis disease from facial image using machine learning adenoviral conjunctivitis pink eye grabcut gray level co occurrence matrix glcm sclera segmentation vascularization nowadays scientist focusing diagnosing certain eye disease using image processing among these disease adenoviral conjunctivitis key eye infection observed diagnosed this paper digital image processing dip applied an automated fast cost effective diagnosis conjunctivitis by physician our study measure vascularization intensity redness pink eye after segmenting region infection corneal image diagnose conjunctivitis corneal image captured using our simple setup processed through proposed dip approach successfully detects eye infection isolates potentially contagious patient correctly 93 time were able achieve this rate by isolating sclera region using automated grabcut method that identifies seed region from image itself such adaptive isolation region interest overcomes challenge presented by lightning resolution during this study evaluated performance known dip method incorporated them eye disease diagnosis
