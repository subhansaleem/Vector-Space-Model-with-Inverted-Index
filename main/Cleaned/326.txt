novel algorithm dynamic clustering property performance dynamic clustering data mining line learning multi density clustering this paper present dynamic clustering algorithm that efficiently deal with data stream achieves several important property which not generally found together same algorithm dynamic clustering algorithm operates online two different time scale stage fast distance based stage that generates micro cluster density based stage that group micro cluster according their density generates final cluster algorithm achieves novelty detection concept drift thanks forgetting function that allows micro cluster final cluster appear drift merge split or disappear this algorithm been designed able detect complex pattern even multi density distribution making assumption cluster convexity performance dynamic clustering algorithm assessed theoretically through complexity analysis empirically through set experiment
