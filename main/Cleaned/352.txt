deep learning based car damage classification automobile training feature extraction machine learning support vector machine glass image based vehicle insurance processing an important area with large scope automation this paper consider problem car damage classification where some category fine granular explore deep learning based technique this purpose initially try directly training cnn however due small set labeled data it doe not work well then explore effect domain specific pre training followed by fine tuning finally experiment with transfer learning ensemble learning experimental result show that transfer learning work better than domain specific fine tuning achieve accuracy 89 5 with combination transfer ensemble learning
