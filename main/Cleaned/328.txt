validation quantifier based fuzzy classification system breast cancer patient external independent cohort rule based classification fuzzy rule validation breast cancer recent study breast cancer domain identified seven distinct clinical phenotype group using immunohistochemical analysis variety unsupervised learning technique consensus among clustering algorithm been used categorise patient into these specific group but often expense not classifying patient it known that fuzzy methodology provide linguistic based classification rule ease those from consensus clustering objective this study present validation recently developed extension fuzzy quantification subsethood based algorithm three set newly available breast cancer data result show that our algorithm able reproduce seven biological class previously identified preserving their characterisation term marker distribution therefore their clinical meaning moreover because our algorithm constitutes fundamental basis newly developed nottingham prognostic index plus npi our finding demonstrate that this new medical decision making tool help moving towards more tailored care breast cancer
