forecasting domestic hot water demand residential house using artificial neural network artificial neural network domestic hot water forecasting energy demand prediction domestic hot water energy consumption key purpose order decrease energy consumed residential house advantage use artificial neural network method it capacity adapt particular consumer without consumption profile lot paper develop artificial neural network model predict energy consumption but they use high quantity parameter this study develop model with only available information classical installation separate our experimental data three kind instant near zero consumption low consumption high consumption moment compare result three model based neural network method each these kind consumption measure reaction time between prediction real consumption moment result show that our model give good accuracy predict moment consumption value high consumption moment
