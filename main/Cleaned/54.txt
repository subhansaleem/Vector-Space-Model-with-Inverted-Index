arctic sea ice extent forecasting using support vector regression arctic sea ice svr time series forecasting summer minimum arctic sea ice extent long been used measure climate change with record low being reported recent year understanding dynamic arctic sea ice extent utmost importance understanding timescales associated with this change complex global climate model typically employed gain insight about future arctic sea ice however these model typically very computationally expensive solve result often controversial here use historical data from remote sensing satellite along with machine learning algorithm forecasting arctic sea ice extent support vector regression employed learning dynamic model represent this system validation result demonstrate ability method successfully forecast both seasonal long term trend arctic sea ice coverage
