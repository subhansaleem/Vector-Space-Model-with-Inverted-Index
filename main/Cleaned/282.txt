energy efficient eeg monitoring system wireless epileptic seizure detection eeg signal seizure detection missing random expectation maximization wireless eeg monitoring system been successfully used seizure detection outside clinical setting wireless eeg sensor node consume considerable amount battery energy acquire encode transmit data server side this paper introduce energy efficient monitoring system increase sensor battery lifetime specifically propose feature extraction method that robust artifact effectively select most discriminant feature relevant seizure second show how use missing random mar method reduce energy required sensor node data transmission without compromising seizure detection accuracy server side finally show how expectation maximization em method used server side accurately substitute missing value performance proposed scheme compared those state art method shown achieve le power consumption without compromising seizure detection accuracy
