using balanced random forest load spectrum data classifying component failure hybridelectric vehicle fleet vegetation index battery tuning hybrid electric vehicle temperature measurement able optimize dimensioning power train hybrid electric vehicle engineer find relationship between stress power train failure it component this paper apply machine learning technique random forest heterogeneous dataset consisting so called load spectrum data resulting from transforming stress time function frequency distribution fatigue analysis this state art data employed calculating fatigue life component i study usability random forest modeled this kind data distinguish between faulty non faulty vehicle ii address problem selecting small number relevant variable order further decrease misclassification rate even more important from our engineering point view identify failure related variable our data contains just very few sample faulty compared non faulty vehicle furthermore present framework tuning random forest handle this class imbalance demonstrate experimentally failure hybrid car battery that using random forest variable selection classification load spectrum data achieves promising classification performance enables engineer identify possible relationship between load failure hybrid component
