toward an online anomaly intrusion detection system based deep learning intrusiondetection dbn rbm attack cyber security neural network machine learning data mining past twenty year progress intrusion detection been steady but slow biggest challenge detect new attack real time this work deep learning approach anomaly detection using restricted boltzmann machine rbm deep belief network implemented our method us one hidden layer rbm perform unsupervised feature reduction resultant weight from this rbm passed another rbm producing deep belief network pre trained weight passed into fine tuning layer consisting logistic regression lr classifier with multi class soft max implemented deep learning architecture c microsoft visual studio 2013 use darpa kddcup 99 dataset evaluate it performance our architecture outperforms previous deep learning method implemented by li salama both detection speed accuracy achieve detection rate 97 9 total 10 kddcup 99 test dataset by improving training process simulation also able produce low false negative rate 2 47 although deficiency kddcup 99 dataset well understood it still present machine learning approach predicting attack with reasonable challenge our future work will include applying our machine learning strategy larger more challenging datasets which include larger class attack
