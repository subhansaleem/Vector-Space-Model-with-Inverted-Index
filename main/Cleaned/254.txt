domain ontology induction using word embeddings language modeling deep learning natural language processing ontology learning word vector clustering latent semantic indexing ontology shared formal conceptualization domain information been shown multiple application modeling processing understanding natural language text this work use distributed word vector out various recent language model from deep learning semi automated domain ontology creation closed domain cover major aspect domain ontology induction or learning like concept identification attribute identification taxonomical non taxonomical relationship identification using distributed word vector preliminary result show that simple clustering based method using distributed word vector from these language model outperforms method using model like lsi ontology learning closed domain
