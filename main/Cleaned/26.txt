human action recognition based mocap information using convolution neural network convolutional neural network cnn motion capture mocap human action recognition an important component semantic analysis human behavior this paper propose an approach human action recognition based motion capture mocap information using convolutional neural network cnn distance based metric computed from mocap information only three human joint used computation feature range temporal variation these distance metric considered design feature which discriminative action recognition convolutional neural network capable recognizing local pattern used identify human action from temporal variation these feature which distorted due inconsistency execution action across observation subject experiment conducted berkeley mhad dataset demonstrate effectiveness proposed approach
