scalable learning entity predicate embeddings knowledge graph completion representation learning semantic web link prediction knowledge graph knowledge graph kg widely used formalism representing knowledge web data focus problem link prediction i e predicting missing link large knowledge graph so discover new fact about world representation learning model that embed entity relation type continuous vector space recently were used achieve new state art link prediction result limiting factor these model that process learning optimal embedding vector really time consuming might even require day computation large kg this work propose principled method sensibly reducing learning time while converging more accurate link prediction model furthermore employ proposed method training evaluating set novel scalable model our extensive evaluation show significant improvement over state art link prediction method several datasets
