forward looking sonar scene matching using deep learning deep learning forward looking sonar scene matching optical image display drastically reduced visibility due underwater turbidity condition sonar imaging present an alternative form environment perception underwater vehicle navigation mapping localization this work present novel method acoustic scene matching therefore developed trained new deep learning architecture designed compare two acoustic image decide if they correspond same underwater scene network named sonar matching network smnet acoustic image used this paper were obtained by forward looking sonar during remotely operated vehicle rov mission geographic positioning system provided rov position ground truth score which used learning process our network proposed method us 36 000 sample real data validation from binary classification perspective our method achieved 98 accuracy when two given scene more than ten percent intersection
