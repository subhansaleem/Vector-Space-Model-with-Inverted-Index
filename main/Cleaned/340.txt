an oblivious routing based power flow calculation method loss minimization smart power network theoretical perspective large scale network flow loss minimization oblivious routing scheme power system power loss minimization play an important role appropriate operation power network line power loss occurs when power transmitted through line network due permittivity line medium transmission loss may increase dispatch cost obtained power flow based market contract hence independent system operator should use loss minimization method facilitate implementation contracted power transaction loss minimization also will improve security stability power network this paper present novel loss minimization scheme based oblivious network design referred oblivious routing based power flow method method built bottom oblivious network routing scheme which offer multiple path from several source generation unit specific destination electric load demand although there limited information regarding other line flow current status network routing scheme mathematically guarantee that power flow solution an approximation optimal solution with specific competitiveness ratio fact our main focus power flow calculation while optimizing power loss compared with recently developed power flow method our approach doe not depend network topology it performance both radial non radial network accurate hence it suitable use propose approach large scale loss minimization while determining power flow this paper mainly focus theoretical aspect proposed method our method based novel concept from computer science discipline provide sufficient explanation about preliminary oblivious routing scheme
