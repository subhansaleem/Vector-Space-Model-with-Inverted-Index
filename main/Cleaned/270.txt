learning fairness under constraint decentralized resource allocation game resource management game learning artificial intelligence computer science robot sensing system electrical engineering study multi type resource allocation multi agent system where some constraint enforced upon resource provider user these constraint limitation resource type connection availability which may make collaboration between agent infeasible discus notion distributed resource fairness under these constraint then propose game theory reinforcement learning based solution collaborative resource allocation so that resource assigned user fairly task assigned resource agent efficiently utilize data from google data center our input simulation result show that our learning approach outperforms greedy random exploration term resource utilization fairness
